<p>In the Kingdom of Little Animals every child is at
home. That a dog can talk to his friends, that a rabbit
may wear knickers or a little bird climb up a tiny stair
inside a hollow tree trunk seem quite natural.</p>

the border into Rabbit Country.</p>

<p>Come, you older ones, turn back the clock. Don’t you
long for a moment to be once more in Make-Believe
Land? Surely you will if you read the Little Jack Rabbit
Books. You again will see yourself in the wistful eyes of
the youngster at your knee as he listens to</p>

</div>

<p>Was some one knocking on the door of Uncle Lucky’s
little white house on the corner of Lettuce Avenue and
Carrot St., Rabbitville, U.S.A.? Well, I guess yes, three
times. Maybe somebody has been knocking ever since
Bobbie Redvest told me that a bad attack of rheumatism
prevents the dear old gentleman rabbit from hearing
unpleasant news. Well, anyway, when Uncle Lucky
opened the door who do you think was standing on the
mat? You’d never guess, not even if I told you he wore
rubber boots and held a green umbrella in his hand.</p>

<p>It was Daddy Longlegs—yes, sir, that’s who it was.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed the old gentleman
rabbit, “are you wet?”</p>

<p>“Soaked to the skin,” replied the shivering, rubber-booted,
long-legged insect. “Let me sit by the kitchen
stove and warm myself. Maybe I’ll get dry in an hour or
so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Come right in!” cried dear, kind Uncle Lucky, leading
the way into the kitchen where little Miss Mousie, the
dear old gentleman rabbit’s tiny housekeeper, was drying
the breakfast dishes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O sunny days, so sweet and warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I miss you very much.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I only hope the rheumatiz</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My little toe won’t touch!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">sang Uncle Lucky, helping Daddy Longlegs pull off his
rubber boots.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the old gentleman insect, stretching
out his cold, damp toes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love the cheerful kitchen fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And though it is so kind</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To warm my frozen tippy toes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’m always cold behind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Turn around once in a while,” replied Uncle Lucky,
“that’s what I do!”</p>

<p>“Don’t set your coat tails on fire,” advised Little Miss
Mousie, as she nibbled a piece of angel cake.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, the Old Red Rooster came in with the
<em>Bunnybridge Bugle</em>, the nice morning paper that dear
Uncle Lucky loves to read when breakfast is over.</p>

<p>Taking out a cabbage leaf cigar, he slipped his feet
into his comfortable woolen slippers and, placing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
gold-rimmed spectacles on his nose, sat down in his big
arm chair.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pitter, patter, went the rain</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">While the fire’s cheerful glow</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Warmed his poor rheumatic toe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By this time Daddy Longlegs was nice and dry, so he,
too, sat down to read by the fire, and Little Miss Mousie,
seeing that nobody wished to talk, scampered back to her
little house in the corner of the sitting room. As for the
Old Red Rooster, he hurried out to the barn to mend the
old wheelbarrow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pitter, patter, sings the rain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a drowsy, soft refrain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ticker, tacker, on the leaves,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tinkle, tinkle, on the pane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rings the wind-blown summer rain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty soon, Uncle Lucky fell asleep and when he
woke up, Mr. Merry Sun was shining and Daddy Longlegs
had gone.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear and oh, dear!” sighed dear Uncle Lucky,
taking out his gold watch and chain, “I wonder what time
it is.”</p>

<p>Then he sighed again and looked out of the window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
But the postman wasn’t in sight, only the Old Red
Rooster raking up the leaves.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” sighed lonely Uncle Lucky, for
the third time, “what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Sing a song,” suggested Little Miss Mousie, peeking
out of her small front door in the far corner of the sitting
room.</p>

<p>“Sing us two songs,” shouted the Old Red Rooster
through the open window.</p>

<p>So down at the piano sat kind Uncle Lucky, and, after
running his paws over the keys, commenced:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When I was young and twenty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And my hair was curly brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I loved a lady bunny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The sweetest in the town.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">One day I bought a ringlet</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At the Three-in-One Cent Store,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And then that eve I called on her</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">But oh, the years have flown since then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Way back in ’63,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And only my old wedding hat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is left to lonely me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then up jumped dear, tender-hearted Uncle Lucky,
and wiping the tears in his left eye, took down his old wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
stovepipe hat and carefully dusted it off with his blue
silk polkadot handkerchief.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the telephone bell began to ring.</p>

<p>“Who’s calling me?” inquired the old gentleman
bunny, taking down the receiver and holding it up to his
left ear.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” he said the next moment. “Well,
I don’t want to talk to you—no, I don’t. You make
me cross,” and with that Uncle Lucky hung up the
receiver and hopped back to his big comfortable armchair.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” asked Little Miss Mousie, running
across the floor to the piano stool, up which she climbed.
Then, smoothing her bobbed hair, she smiled sweetly at
the old gentleman bunny.</p>

<p>“Chatterbox, the red squirrel,” answered Uncle
Lucky. “He has a funny story to tell me, but my rheumatism
won’t listen to anything, so I excused myself. Dear
me, how my little left hind toe aches. I must be careful
or I’ll be full of crossness.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never be full of anything but kindness,” replied
Little Miss Mousie, arranging the cushions in the
big armchair. And she spoke the truth, don’t you think
so, dear little girls and boys?</p>

<p>But poor Uncle Lucky couldn’t fall asleep again, nor
could he eat the nice luncheon which Little Miss Mousie
brought in on a silver tray.</p>

<p>By and by, after smoking a cabbage-leaf cigar, he said
with a sigh, “I guess I’ll play a tune; maybe I’ll sing another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
song,” and hopping over to the piano, he turned the
little stool around three times and a half, and commenced
to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When she was only sweet sixteen</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I loved a little rabbit queen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Her eyes were pink as any rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And even pinker was her nose.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">And pinker far her ears inside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And when she said she’d be my bride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I bought a lovely wedding ring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And we were married in the spring.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Heigh ho, how the years go!” sighed the old gentleman
rabbit and, taking out his gold watch and chain, he
suddenly exclaimed: “<em>Goodness gracious meebus! It’s
almost time for the wedding!</em>”</p>

<p>Quickly putting on his old wedding stovepipe hat, he
hopped out of his little house.</p>

<p>You see, his dear bunny niece, pretty Lady Love, had
decided to get married and settle down in the Old Bramble
Patch. Perhaps that’s why Uncle Lucky sang the
song about the pretty rabbit queen.</p>

<p>And now I’ll tell you about the wedding. All the
Shady Forest folk were there, of course, and so were the
Sunny Meadow people.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Old Mrs. Bunny had put her house in apple-pie order,
and after the wedding in the Shady Forest, and Parson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>Owl had given Lady Love, the pretty little lady bunny, to
Mr. Rabbit to care for all the rest of his life, everybody
started back to the Old Bramble Patch. Goodness me, it
was a long procession! Squirrel Nutcracker, the Big
Brown Bear, Granddaddy Bullfrog, Grandmother Magpie,
Busy Beaver, Sammy Skunk, the Old Brown Horse,
Mrs. Grouse, Chippy Chipmunk, the Stage Coach Dog,
the Old Red Rooster, the Yellow Dog Tramp, the Policeman
Dog, Old Barney Owl, the Circus Elephant, the sure-footed
little Mountain Goat, and all the Barnyard Folk.
Everybody was anxious to see the little house that dear
Uncle Lucky had built for Lady Love.</p>

<p>Well, when they all reached the Old Bramble Patch,
there stood dear Uncle Lucky on the front porch, his old
wedding stovepipe hat in his front paw and his big diamond
horseshoe pin in his pink cravat. Yes, sir, there he
stood, bowing and smiling just as if it were his own wedding
day and not somebody else’s, as Mr. Rabbit and
Lady Love hopped up the path and into the house to stand
under a big horseshoe wreath of clover and shake hands
with all their friends.</p>

<p>Just as everybody had finished looking at the wedding
presents, and dear Uncle Lucky was saying, “Bless you,
my children!” Danny Fox peeped into the window and
shouted: “Don’t be frightened! Here’s a diamond necklace
for Lady Love.” Then away he ran, knowing that
nobody wanted him around; for he is a dreadful robber,
you know, and robbers aren’t invited to a wedding. They
come later to</p>

<p>At last, when the lollypop juice was all gone, and the
grasshopper orchestra tired of playing, somebody called
on Uncle Lucky for a song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My dear old wedding hat</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">sang the old gentleman rabbit, wiping a tear from his left
eye with his blue silk polkadot handkerchief. Then kissing
the bride good-by, he stopped for a moment to hang
up an old horseshoe on the front porch and then led the
guests away, leaving pretty Lady Love and Mr. Rabbit
to fill the little white bungalow with happiness in the
years to come.</p>

<p>By and by a little rabbit boy came to make their dream
come true. As soon as the glad news was telephoned to
dear Uncle Lucky, that happy old gentleman rabbit
hopped into his Luckymobile and started off as fast as a
comet for the little white bungalow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>All the way over he honked the horn to bring out all
the Shady Forest Folk from their tree houses and burrows.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Squirrel Nutcracker from
his Old Tree Lodge.</p>

<p>“Lady Love has a little boy rabbit!” answered Uncle
Lucky.</p>

<p>“What’s all the noise about?” inquired Busy Beaver,
swimming up to the bank of the Shady Forest Pool.</p>

<p>“Lady Love has a little rabbit boy!” answered Uncle
Lucky.</p>

<p>“Stop blowing that horn!” snapped Grandmother
Magpie from her perch in the tall pine tree.</p>

<p>“Not for a minute,” shouted back dear Uncle Lucky.
“Lady Love has a little boy rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Are you going crazy?” asked the Big Brown Bear
as the Luckymobile whizzed by the Cozy Cave.</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to see my little grandnephew,” answered
Uncle Lucky. “Lady Love has a baby rabbit.”</p>

<p>“You’ll wake up my babies,” cried Mrs. Bobbie
Redvest, as the Luckymobile rushed past the Apple
Orchard.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” shouted back Uncle Lucky. “Tell ’em
there’s a new baby at the Old Bramble Patch. Lady Love
has a little boy rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, what a noise!” croaked Granddaddy
Bullfrog, as Uncle Lucky circled the Old Duck Pond.
“Has the old gentleman rabbit lost his wits?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered dear Uncle Lucky. “I’m off for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the Old Bramble Patch to see Lady Love’s little boy rabbit.
He just came to-day.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Chippy Chipmunk, as
Uncle Lucky sped by the Old Chestnut Tree.</p>

<p>“To see Little Jack Rabbit, Lady Love’s baby,” answered
the old gentleman rabbit.</p>

<p>And so it went. Everybody wanted to know what was
the matter, and when Uncle Lucky finally reached the
dear Old Bramble Patch he had told the glad news to
every single solitary person in the Shady Forest and
Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen Old Mrs. Bunny, who had come
over for the day, was baking cabbage cake and Mr. Rabbit
was reading in the <em>Bunnybridge Bugle</em> a story about
the new baby rabbit in the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Look, mother!” cried the proud rabbit father, turning
the paper toward the good lady bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” she exclaimed. “There’s his picture
as sure as I’m a grandmother and you’re my son.”</p>

<p>Yes, sir! On the front page was a picture of Little
Jack Rabbit, and underneath, in big purple letters:</p>

<p>“A new arrival at the Old Bramble Patch. Lady Love
has a baby boy bunny. Carrot City, Bunnybridge, Lettucemere
and Turnip City papers please copy.”</p>

<p>“It makes me as proud as a peacock to see it in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
paper,” laughed Mr. Rabbit. “And to think that Little
Jack Rabbit will soon be old enough to hop about the
Sunny Meadow and through the Shady Forest.”</p>

<p>Just then in came Timmie Meadowmouse to see the
new little bunny boy.</p>

<p>“Little Jack Rabbit is asleep,” explained his careful
father. “Why didn’t you come early this afternoon?
You ought to know, Timmie Meadowmouse, that little
bunny babies are asleep by this hour.”</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked the little Meadowmouse “I
left my watch home.”</p>

tiny meadowmouse, holding his cap in his left paw as
he turned the brass doorknob. “I want to tell the Sunny

<p>“Come along, then, on your tiptoes,” answered Mr.
Rabbit, leading the little meadowmouse to the bedroom
where the bunny baby lay sound asleep.</p>

<p>“S-s-s-s-h!” whispered Lady Love from the rocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
chair close by, as Timmie Meadowmouse stood on his
hind legs to peep into the cradle.</p>

<p>“He’ll be running about in a day or two,” chuckled
Mr. Rabbit, as he said good night to Timmie Meadowmouse.
“He’ll be out with Uncle Lucky in no time.”</p>

<p>Just then the Old Red Rooster began to crow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, things have changed in the Bramble Patch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’ve scarcely a moment’s time to scratch;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With Little Jack Rabbit to teach and learn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’ve hardly the time my wage to earn.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Did you ever!” laughed Old Mrs. Bunny from the
kitchen door. “One would think the Old Red Rooster
was a busy person! He’d rather rest on his hoe and talk
to Little Jack Rabbit than weed the garden. My, but he’s
a lazy fowl!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” answered Uncle Lucky, hopping
around the little white house. Not far away Little Jack
Rabbit and the Old Red Rooster were feeding the
pigeons, who had flown down from their pretty house on
the top of a tall pole.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, young rabbit!” cried Uncle Lucky.
“Don’t pull the tail feathers out of the Old Red Rooster’s
swallow tail coat!” You see, Little Jack Rabbit was making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
believe the good-natured rooster was a horse and he
was driving him to the station at Bunnybridge.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve just come in from a drive,” answered Uncle
Lucky. “I had some business to attend to in Carrot
City.”</p>

<p>“When are you going to take me for a ride?”</p>

<p>“Wait a little longer till you’re big enough to look
out for yourself,” answered wise old Uncle Lucky.
“There’s no telling when Danny Fox or Old Man
Weasel may pop out from behind a tree. You’re safer
here in the Old Bramble Patch for a while yet.”</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Old Red Rooster gave a warning.
Quick as a wink into the Little Red Barn hopped the two
bunnies, Uncle Lucky first, Little Jack Rabbit next and
last, but just as fast, the Old Red Rooster.</p>

<p>Closing the door, they peeped out through a knothole.
There in the back yard stood Hungry Hawk.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha! Ha, ha!” cried Hungry Hawk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As he flew at the door with a dreadful squawk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“This Little Red Barn’s a pretty good place</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For rabbits to hide from my grinning face.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And, hopping around the barn, that old robber bird
peeked in through every crack. By and by he came to
quite a large knothole. Oh, dear me, yes! It was big
enough for his head, and then it seemed almost large
enough for his body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed anxious
Uncle Lucky, “I’m afraid that old bird will squeeze in.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wait a minute, hold your breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Don’t you sneeze or titter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll show that dreadful robber bird</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That I’m a home run hitter,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">whispered the Old Red Rooster, and the next minute he
had crept over on his tiptoes to the tool closet for the big
heavy wooden mallet.</p>

<p>Hungry Hawk didn’t notice the Old Red Rooster.
No, siree, ma’am! He was too busy pushing and shoving,
and shoving and pushing. He surely thought that
pretty soon he’d be in the barn, feasting on two nice rabbits
and maybe a fat rooster.</p>

<p>How he did squirm and twist and twist and squirm!
Dear me! I hope he doesn’t get both his wings through
the knothole before the Old Red Rooster can swing the
big wooden mallet. Because, if once inside, Hungry
Hawk will put up a dreadful fight and maybe get the best
of the two little rabbits and the Old Red Rooster.</p>

<p>Dear me! again. I wish I could tell the Kind Policeman
Dog over the wireless what is going on in the Little
Red Barn. He wouldn’t wait a minute. No, sireemam!
He’d come with his hickory stick and knock Hungry
Hawk’s tail right off before the Old Red Rooster had
time to swing the big wooden mallet.</p>

<p>But there’s no use wishing for things. Just get out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and get them! That’s the way. So, here we go! Old Red
Rooster, hurry up! And that’s just what he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whack!</span> Down came the wooden mallet on Hungry
Hawk’s head. Whew! How mad he was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whack!</span> Again the Old Red Rooster tickled the
wicked hawk’s head.</p>

<p>“Give him another!” shouted Uncle Lucky, hiding
Little Jack Rabbit behind his coat tails. “Hit him again,
and three times more!”</p>

<p>Now, let me see. What did Hungry Hawk do after
Uncle Lucky shouted to the Old Red Rooster; “Hit him
again!” Well, what would you think he’d do? First, he
hid his head under his wing; then he tried to squeeze back
through the knothole. But he couldn’t, for his feathers
turned up at the end and made him bigger than ever.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to break your head,” said the Old Red
Rooster. “This wooden mallet is pretty hard. But if
you think you’re going to eat Uncle Lucky or Little Jack
Rabbit or yours truly, you’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“You bet you have!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky. “You
better go home to Mrs. Hawk and lead a better life hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I wish I could,” answered Hungry
Hawk, “I’ve got an awful headache. The Old Red
Rooster hit me three times with the wooden mallet.”</p>

<p>Just then who should hop into the barn but the Policeman
Dog. I wonder how he found out what was
going on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“You wicked bird! I’ve a good notion to shoot you,”
he shouted, pulling his gun from his hip pocket.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” begged Hungry Hawk, his tail feathers
twitching and his eyes blinking with fright. My, but
he was scared. For that Policeman Dog’s gun was a
warlike looking weapon, let me tell you. The handle was
red and the barrel black and the bullet as yellow as a
dandelion.</p>

<p>“I’ll take three minutes to think about it,” answered
the Policeman Dog. “But what are you going to do?
You can’t get out and you can’t get in, I guess you wish
you were thin as a pin.”</p>

<p>Just think of a Policeman Dog making up poetry at
a dangerous time like this. Well, I never.</p>

<p>“I’m worried enough to grow thin,” answered Hungry
Hawk. “Besides, I’m dreadfully uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” suddenly exclaimed wise Uncle
Lucky, “I’ll knock out the board. Maybe it will split in
two and free the old bird.”</p>

<p>“Please be careful,” begged Hungry Hawk, as the old
gentleman rabbit lifted the heavy wooden mallet, “please
don’t make a mistake and hit me.”</p>

<p>“One, two, three!” sang out Uncle Lucky, and down
came the mallet, whack! against the board. The next
minute Hungry Hawk found himself by the woodpile.
But, dear me! The board hadn’t cracked open. No, the
nails had just pulled out of the Big Red Barn.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the old hawk gave a tre-men-dous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
squirm and away he flew, with a whirr of wings, above
the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t bother little rabbits for some time,”
cried Uncle Lucky. But, children dear, I’m sorry to say,
a little further on in the book he does something dreadful.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LOLLYPOP TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I must run up to see the Big Brown Bear,” thought
Little Jack Rabbit, looking up at Mr. Merry Sun shining
in the Blue Sky Country.</p>

<p>“I want you to hop down to the Three-in-One-Cent
Store for a clothes-pin,” said Lady Love, his pretty bunny
mother.</p>

<p>“All right, mother dear,” answered the little rabbit,
tucking the napkin under his chin and helping himself
to a big slice of carrot cake.</p>

<p>My, what a nice breakfast his bunny mother had made
for him—carrot cakes with lollypop syrup, turnip tea and
lettuce marmalade.</p>

<p>As soon as the little rabbit had brought in the kindling
wood, fed the canary and polished the front door knob,
he kissed his pretty bunny mother good-by and hopped
down the winding path through the brambles to the
Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>Peeking out of his little front door stood Timmie
Meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Little Jack Rabbit, stopping before
the tiny, round grass-ball house, hung on three stiff stalks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
of grass about six inches above the ground, “Where do
you think I’m going?”</p>

<p>“Well, wherever you’re going,” answered the timid
meadowmouse, peering anxiously out of the small round
hole that serves for his front door, “you’d better look out
for Danny Fox.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will,” replied Little Jack Rabbit. “And I’ll
bring you a lollypop, ’cause I’m going up to see the Big
Brown Bear and the Lollypop Tree. Good-by,” and away
hopped the little bunny, clipperty clip, lipperty lip, up
the Old Cow Path in the Sunny Meadow and over the
hill top until, by and by, not so very long, he came to the
Shady Forest, where he paused for a moment to inquire
how Mrs. Nutcracker was getting along.</p>

<p>“Very nicely, thank you,” replied old Squirrel Nutcracker,
dropping a handful of nuts in the little rabbit’s
pocket. “She’ll soon be around again.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” answered the kind-hearted little
bunny boy, “mother sends her love,” and off he hopped
up the Shady Forest Trail.</p>

<p>As he passed the pool in which Busy Beaver has his
home, he stopped to say “Hello.”</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” shouted back the little beaver.
“How are all the folks?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, except dear Uncle Lucky Lefthindfoot,”
answered the little bunny rabbit boy. “He has
the rheumatism in his left hind toe and Dr. Quack says
it will be some time before he can do a toe dance.”</p>

<br>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” laughed the happy little beaver,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>giving his big broad tail a sudden flap, sending the spray
all over the little rabbit boy bunny’s fur coat, “but why
should Uncle Lucky want to do a toe dance, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the little rabbit, wiping the
water drops off his coat sleeve. “You’ve splashed me all
over, Busy Beaver, yes, you have,” and away went the
little rabbit, for it was nearly a mile and a whistle and
a smile to Cozy Cave where the Big Brown Bear sold</p>

<p>Dear me! Doesn’t that sound delicious? If only I
had the time I’d leave my typewriter to run over to the
Big Brown Bear. Would you come with me, little
reader? I guess you would, and so would your little
brother Jimmy.</p>

<p>Well, now where was I before I began to dream? I
was on my way to Cozy Cave for a gum drop? Oh, yes,
Little Jack Rabbit had stopped before I had even started,
so I’ll tell you without digressing further, which means
to go off sideways—what the little bunny did.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” asked Chippy Chipmunk, running
along the top of the Old Rail Fence, his red striped
jacket shining in the morning sun and his eyes twinkling
with curiosity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To the cozy cave of the Big Brown Bear,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>“Bring me a lollypop,” shouted Chippy Chipmunk
as the little rabbit boy hopped up the Shady Forest Trail,
in and out among the trees, where Billy Breeze whistled
amid the leaves.</p>

<p>By and by, way, way yonder, he could just make out
the comfortable figure of the Big Brown Bear sitting in
front of his cozy cave, smoking a corncob pipe.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello!” shouted the little rabbit, waving his
red-striped candy cane. “Are you there, Mr. Bear?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m here,” chuckled the big good-natured, furry-coated
animal, “but just keep on, you’ll find me all right.”</p>

<p>“How’s mother?” he asked, taking the old corncob
pipe from between his beautiful white pearly teeth, as the
breathless little rabbit stood before him.</p>

<p>“She’s well, thank you,” panted the little bunny boy,
looking up at the lollypops as they winked their purple-pinky
eyes from the branches of the Lollypop Tree.</p>

<p>“Did you do your three chores for mother this morning?”
enquired the Big Brown Bear, although the little
bunny boy wished to goodness gracious he would stop
asking questions and give him a lollypop.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, oh, yes!” answered the wistful-eyed little
rabbit.</p>

<p>“You polished the front door knob, fed the canary
and brought in the kindling wood?” continued the questioning
old bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, oh, yes,” repeated the little bunny boy rabbit,
only this time he shouted it.</p>

<p>“That’s a good lad,” laughed the Big Brown Bear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
handing a pink lollypop to his little long-eared caller.
“Have a lollypop!”</p>

<p>And then, would you believe it, that big bear put
away his pipe and began to suck a green lollypop. Just
fancy that if you can! Pretty soon he said with a smile,
“Want another?”</p>

<p>“Have you any left?” asked the bunny boy, oh, so
wist-ful-ly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see,” answered the Big Brown Bear, rising
to his feet and ambling into the cozy cave. But, oh, dear
me! the only things he found were a popcorn ball and
an empty ice cream cone.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!” he exclaimed, coming out
again into the sunlight, “I guess I’ll have to climb the
Lollypop Tree.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take him long to swing himself up, and as
he climbed higher and higher, the little rabbit watched
him anxiously. Pretty soon the Big Brown Bear reached
the branches where the lollypops grow in a rainbow row.</p>

<p>“Do you want that nice pink one?” he asked, looking
down into the little rabbit’s upturned face.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” shouted the bunny boy. “And that green
one, too, and that one all blue, and maybe a purple one
for you.”</p>

<p>Carefully picking off the lollypops, the big kind animal
shoved them into his coat pocket. Then sliding down
the tree, he walked over and sat down on the big wooden
bench.</p>

<p>“Come, hop up beside me. We’ll sing the lollypop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
song!” and moving over to one side to make room for
the little rabbit he held up the purple lollypop. Then the
little bunny held up the pink lollypop, and, both together,
all at once, just at the same time, they shouted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hip, Hip, Hurray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I lick a lollypop every day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Pretty soon the lollypops were licked all to pieces—nothing
was left but the two little sticks.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” chuckled the Big Brown Bear, taking
out of his pocket the green and blue lollypops. Then he
and his little bunny friend held them up in the same way,
singing all over again the lovely lollypop song, and when
only the little sticks remained, the Big Brown Bear asked
with a smile:</p>

<p>“What shall we do now?”</p>

<p>“Let’s have one more lollypop and one more song,”
answered the little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, dearest me! I must climb up the Lollypop
Tree!” sighed the Big Brown Bear. But he was so
kind and he was so good that up he went, until at last
he came to the row where the beautiful, luscious lollypops
grow.</p>

<p>“Do you want that yellow one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do, and that red one, too,” shouted the
little rabbit, “and that orange one will be good for you.”</p>

<p>Picking them off the branches with his furry paw, the
Big Brown Bear slipped them in his pocket and, scrambling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
down to the ground, walked over to the big wooden
bench. The little rabbit followed close at his heels and,
jumping up beside him, peeked into the good-natured
animal’s pocket.</p>

<p>“My, what a hungry little bunny,” laughed the Big
Brown Bear, pulling out the lollypops. Then, holding
up the orange colored one in his right paw, he waited
for the little bunny boy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hip, Hip, Hurray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I lick a lollypop every day,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">they shouted all over again; and not until the lollypops
were all gone did the little rabbit suddenly remember the
errand for his mother.</p>

<p>“Dear, oh, dear! I almost forgot that mother wants
a clothes-pin from the Three-in-One Cent Store. Good-by,
Mr. Big Brown Bear,” and away hopped the little
rabbit down the winding trail, in and out among the trees,
until at last he hopped across Busy Beaver’s dam that
held back the water in the Bubbling Brook.</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry?” asked the beaver.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop me!” replied the little bunny boy.
“Mother asked me to get a clothes-pin,” and, hitching
up his little knapsack, he swung his little striped candy
cane around three times and a half and hopped merrily
up the Old Cow Path toward the farmyard.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cackled Henny Jenny, as he peeked in
through the fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” crowed Cocky Doodle.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty well,” answered the bunny boy rabbit, “but
don’t stop me! I must get a clothes-pin for mother at
the Three-in-One Cent Store.”</p>

<p>But, dear me! Just then Ducky Waddles shuffled
around the big haystack and Turkey Tim strutted across
the yard. Of course they, too, shouted “Hello!” and the
next minute the Weathercock on the big Red Barn spun
around on his gilded toe and asked the little rabbit the
time.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the little bunny, taking out the
big gold watch which Uncle Lucky had given him for
a birthday present, “I’m afraid to look—I’ve wasted so
much time this morning.” And then, oh, how I hate to
tell it, something dreadful happened.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All of a sudden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just like that,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” thought the little rabbit, backing away
toward the old apple tree, “Black Cat will surely scratch
all the little buttons off my fur overcoat.”</p>

<p>“Meow! Meow!” cried Black Cat, creeping forward,
his wicked green eyes blazing like balls of fire and his
sharp claws sticking out of his fur-mittens.</p>

<p>And the poor little rabbit, his back against the old
apple tree, stood all a-tremble, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“Go way, go way!” he cried. But closer and closer
crept the wicked cat in his long black coat.</p>

<p>All of a sudden a little voice from a treetop whispered:</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember how your mother taught you
to defend yourself?”</p>

<p>Then, of course, the little rabbit boy remembered the
only way a bunny can protect himself. Turning around
as quick as a flash, he struck out with his two strong hind
legs, hitting Black Cat such a welt in the belt that all the
breath was knocked out of him. It took the old cat five
minutes to find it. And while he hunted here and there,
under a stone and behind a bush, away hopped the little
rabbit, clipperty clip, lipperty lip, down the road to
Rabbitville.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget next time to remember what mother tells
you,” called little Bobbie Redvest from the apple tree.</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t, I won’t!” shouted the little bunny boy
over his shoulder, “I’m trying now to remember the
clothes-pin!” and away he hopped faster than ever to
the Three-in-One Cent Store.</p>

<span class="fs80">UNCLE LUCKY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Goodness me! boys and girls, I think I forgot to mention
that just back of Uncle Lucky’s little white house
stood a tiny garage in which he kept his Luckymobile,
the fastest car in all Rabbitville. Sometimes it went so
fast that the hind wheels couldn’t keep up with the front
wheels. Then, of course, the old gentleman rabbit had
to honk the horn and put on the brakes to avoid a dreadful
accident.</p>

<p>One morning dear Uncle Lucky hopped into the
kitchen where Little Miss Mousie was setting the breakfast
table while the turnip tea was singing on the stove.</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was over the old gentleman rabbit
slipped his big diamond horseshoe pin into his purple
cravat and buttoned up his pink waistcoat. Then tying
his blue silk polkadot handkerchief over the top of his
old wedding stovepipe hat and under his chin to keep
Billy Breeze from blowing it off, he shouted, “Good-by,
Little Miss Mousie!” and hopped out to the garage, where
the old Red Rooster was cleaning the Luckymobile
cushions with his feather duster tail.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed dear Uncle Lucky, hopping into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the Luckymobile, “I’m going to take Little Jack Rabbit
out for a ride.” And, giving the horn a honk or two, he
whizzed through the little gate in the white picket fence.
At Cabbage Street he turned off Lettuce Avenue and into
the Shady Forest. By and by, after a while, he reached
the dear Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“I’ll be out in just a minute!” shouted Little Jack
Rabbit in answer to the three honks of the Luckymobile
horn. “I’ve almost finished polishing the front door
knob.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry!” replied the old gentleman rabbit, hopping
around to the kitchen where Lady Love, the little
rabbit’s mother, was wiping the dishes.</p>

<p>“Here comes Uncle Lucky!” chirped the little Black
Cricket from the woodbox by the kitchen stove.</p>

<p>“Here comes Uncle Lucky!” sang the Three Little
Grasshoppers, while the pretty Canary from her gold
cage twittered a song of welcome and the Hollyhocks
nodded their heads as the old gentleman rabbit hopped
up on the little back porch.</p>

<p>Lady Love pushed forward the big rocking chair and
when the old gentleman bunny was comfortably seated,
handed him a cup of turnip tea.</p>

<p>“Ah, me!” he sighed, though smiling at Lady Love:</p>

<p class="no-indent">and taking a blue silk polkadot handkerchief out of his
coat-tail pocket, dear kind Uncle Lucky wiped a tear from
his left eye.</p>

<p>Pretty soon when Little Jack Rabbit had finished polishing
the front door knob, he and Uncle Lucky hopped
out to the Luckymobile and drove away across the Sunny
Meadow, up the Old Cow Path and over the hill-top, to
the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>Everything was going along so nicely and Billy
Breeze was whistling such a merry tune in the treetops
when, all of a sudden, just like that, quick as the bills on
the first of the month, something happened. Isn’t it too
bad that unpleasant things always happen when these two
dear little rabbits are enjoying themselves?</p>

<p>Before Uncle Lucky could stop the Luckymobile it
ran straight into a big log that lay across the Shady Forest
Path, and out went the two little bunnies. No sooner had
they picked themselves up than whom should they see
peeping around a tree, but Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! oh, dear!” whispered Little Jack Rabbit,
“let’s turn back.”</p>

<p>But, goodness gracious me! who was standing not far
behind them, but Danny Fox!</p>

<p>“Worse and worse,” sighed poor dear Uncle Lucky,
hopping off sideways when, all of a sudden, Old Man
Weasel crept from behind a stone.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” cried the poor little rabbit, all
a-tremble with fright. “Won’t somebody come to help
us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Then brave Uncle Lucky held the door tight shut
with his strong hind legs while the little rabbit peeped
out through a knothole.</p>

<p>“Is he coming? Is he coming?” asked the anxious
old gentleman rabbit, still holding the door tightly closed
with his strong hind legs.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can see him with my left eye,” answered
the little rabbit, again squinting through the knothole.
“Here he comes! Here he comes!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the big kind Policeman Dog in his long
blue coat with its big silver star was running swiftly across
the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>“Here, I am!” he shouted, waving his hickory stick
and blowing his big shrill whistle.</p>

<p>No sooner did Danny Fox hear that whistle than he
ran through the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>No sooner did Mr. Wicked Wolf see the big kind
Policeman Dog than he, too, turned and fled.</p>

<p>As for Old Man Weasel, he crawled under the bed on
reaching home and never dared to come out for a week
and a day.</p>

<p>“Everything is safe now!” shouted the big kind
Policeman Dog, tapping the little door of the old Hollow
Stump Telephone Booth with his big hickory stick. So
out hopped the two little rabbits.</p>

<p>“Here, take this!” cried dear generous Uncle Lucky,
pulling out of his wallet a ten dollar lettuce leaf bill for
the brave Policeman Dog. “Buy the Missus a new calico
apron and the little bow-wow some candy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the good Policeman Dog, saluting
the old gentleman rabbit with his right paw, and away
he ran to the Police Station in Rabbitville.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better go home,” said the old gentleman
rabbit. “We’ve had enough trouble for to-day,” and before
long he drove through the gate in the white picket
fence and around to the garage in the rear of his little
white house on the corner of Lettuce Avenue and Carrot
Street, Rabbitville.</p>

<p>There stood the Old Red Rooster, polishing his spurs
with Uncle Lucky’s shoe brush.</p>

<p>“Are you going to a wedding?” asked the old gentleman
rabbit, winking at Mrs. Swallow, who was peeping
out of her mud house under the eaves.</p>

<p>“No, to a fight!” answered the Old Red Rooster.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better bring in some cabbage leaves,” said
the old gentleman rabbit, hopping down the little path
under the grape arbor and around the Old Well to the
garden. “Miss Mousie can make us a nice salad for
lunch.” And while his little mouse housekeeper was setting
the table, he and Little Jack Rabbit hopped out on
the front porch where, just under the roof, pretty Mrs.
Sparrow had a nest crowded with little birdies.</p>

<p>Sitting down in the hammock, the old gentleman rabbit
swung back and forth, while his little bunny nephew
looked in the croquet box to see if Hungry Hawk had
stolen one of the nice wooden balls.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, when the old gentleman rabbit had fallen
asleep, Mrs. Sparrow whispered in the little bunny’s ear,</p>

<p>By and by Little Miss Mousie came to the front door
to say that luncheon was ready.</p>

<p>“Dearest me!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky, “did I fall
asleep?” and jumping out of the hammock, he winked at
little Mrs. Sparrow. Then calling to Little Jack Rabbit,
he hopped through the front hall, where the Old Grandfather

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed the old gentleman
rabbit, hanging his old wedding stovepipe hat on
the hat-stand, “I’m as hungry as three bears!”</p>

<p>“So am I,” laughed the little rabbit, “I could eat a bag
of animal crackers!”</p>

<p>“Dearest me! Somebody’s knocking,” exclaimed the
old gentleman rabbit, as Little Miss Mousie brought in
the lollypop stew. “I wonder if it’s Old Man Trouble?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” answered Little Miss Mousie, peeking
through the keyhole. “It’s Granddaddy Bullfrog.”</p>

<p>“Ask him in! Don’t keep him waiting!” shouted
dear hospitable Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“You’re just in time for lunch,” he added, as the old
gentleman frog hopped into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Pushing up a chair, Little Miss Mousie made an extra
place for him at the neat little table. But, oh, dear me!
she forgot to give him a napkin, and because the old gentleman
frog was too polite to ask for one while eating a
raspberry tart, one of the raspberries rolled down his
white waistcoat!</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed dear Uncle
Lucky, suddenly seeing the big red stain, “were you signing
checks with red ink this morning?”</p>

<p>But before the embarrassed old frog could answer
kind Little Miss Mousie washed off the spot with a gasolene
cloth.</p>

<p>After the meal was over Uncle Lucky and Granddaddy
Bullfrog hopped out on the front porch to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
pinochle and the little rabbit went out to talk to the Old
Red Rooster, who was still polishing his spurs in the Old
Red Barn.</p>

<p>By and by the little bunny grew restless and, thinking
he had better be going, he hopped around to the kitchen
to say good-by to Little Miss Mousie. After she had
filled his pockets with sweet cookies, he stopped a moment
at the front porch, but Uncle Lucky and Granddaddy
Bullfrog were so busy with their game that they
never noticed him.</p>

<p>“I’ll say good-by for you,” twittered little Mrs. Sparrow,
knowing that the little bunny didn’t want dear Uncle
Lucky to wonder what had become of him.</p>

wicked old fox to the nose of every little animal. Yes, sir,
that’s how Billy Breeze whispers bad news!</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m safe at home,” thought the little bunny,
as he opened the little gate in the white picket fence
around the dear Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Dear, oh, dear!” sighed Mrs. Grouse, hiding her
brood under her wings amid the brown underbrush.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!” cackled little Henny Jenny,
“I’m glad Old Sic’em, the farmer’s dog, is around. I hope
the Farmer’s Boy won’t whistle to him.”</p>

head, making the little bell on her collar ting-a-ling. “So
old Danny Fox is out hunting!”</p>

<p>Then the motherly lady cow walked over to rub her
nose against the silky ear of her long-legged little calf.
“But you needn’t be afraid of that old robber. He eats
only little defenseless bunnies and chickens. He’s no
real hunter. Oh, my, no! He’s only a sneak thief.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re saying about me?” asked a voice,
all of a sudden, quick as a lightning bug or a tornado.</p>

<p>There stood Danny Fox himself, close by the Old Rail
Fence.</p>

<p>“Moo-oo! Moo-oo!” answered Mrs. Cow, lowering
her head till her horns pointed right at his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“S-s-s-h!” whispered the sly old robber, “maybe the

<p>“I don’t care if he does,” answered Mrs. Cow, giving
her head a toss, but quickly lowering it to bring the tips
of her horns on a level with Danny Fox’s eyes. “Don’t
you bother me, you old rascal.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Danny Fox, carefully peering
here and there, however, for fear some one might be coming
by, “I’m not afraid of you. Besides, you have a thimble
on each of your horns.”</p>

<p>They weren’t real thimbles, you know, but the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
brass caps which the Farmer had fastened on. Danny
Fox thought they were thimbles because Mrs. Fox used
a thimble when she mended Bushytail’s coat or Slyboot’s
trousers.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you say, you old robber,” answered
Mrs. Cow with a loud moo-oo! walking up to the fence
as brave as a fireman or a policeman. “Get out, or I’ll
toss you over the Bubbling Brook, or maybe farther!”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get disagreeable,” whined the old fox,
“I’m going along. Maybe I’ll find a nice little rabbit for
supper.”</p>

<p>But he won’t catch Little Jack Rabbit. No, indeed!
That dear little bunny boy is safe in the Old Bramble

<span class="fs80">THE RADIO ALARM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Lady Love, the little rabbit’s
pretty mother, “where is my bunny boy?” and the worried
lady rabbit hopped out of the kitchen of the tiny white
bungalow down to the edge of the Sunny Meadow. Shading
her eyes with her paw, she looked up the old Cow Path
to the Big Red Barn, but no little bunny boy could she
see there or anywhere.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she sighed again, “what has become of
him. I hope Danny Fox isn’t chasing him in the Shady
Forest.”</p>

<p>For some time she stood at the edge of the Old Bramble
Patch, looking across the meadow, but at last she
turned and hopped up the little path through the brambles
to the tiny garden in the rear of her pretty white
bungalow.</p>

<p>“I’ll pick some carrots and lettuce,” she said to herself.
Filling her apron, she had hardly turned to hop
into her neat little kitchen when, all of a sudden, just like
that, quick as the wind that blows off your hat, over the
Old Rail Fence jumped Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” she cried.</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear!” laughed Danny Fox, creeping
toward her, “how sweet and tender you look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Poor little Lady Love dropped the carrots and lettuce
and hopped toward the barn, but Wicked Danny Fox was
too quick for her. Then she tried to hop over to the woodpile,
but the nimble old beast again jumped in front of
her.</p>

<p>“You’d better let me put you in my bag,” snarled the
cruel beast. “If you don’t, I’ll bite off your left ear.”</p>

<p>“Please, oh, please, don’t touch me,” cried the frightened
little bunny lady. “Oh, oh, oh.”</p>

<p>Just then a friendly bark sounded near, and the next
minute over the fence came the Yellow Dog Tramp.</p>

<p>“Get out!” he shouted, and, picking up a stick of wood,
he hit the old fox over the head.</p>

<p>“Ouch! ouch!” yelled that old robber, and away he
sneaked, leaving Lady Love and the kind dog to pick up
the carrots and lettuce leaves.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” thought the old fox, as he ran into the
Shady Forest, “it grows worse every day. Some one always
comes at the wrong time.”</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, this old robber hardly knew what to do.
Every time he started out from his den in the rocky hillside,
somebody would call over the wireless:</p>

<p>“Danny Fox is going hunting!”</p>

<p>After that warning, of course, everybody locked his
front door and bolted his back door and pulled down the
window shades.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, one dark gloomy night to Mrs.
Fox, “maybe I can bring home a chicken—it’s dark
enough to hide me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>So off he started with a big empty bag over his shoulder.
As he softly crept through the Shady Forest he saw
a little twinkling star.</p>

<p>“Now, who’s that, I wonder?” he asked himself in a
whisper. But, of course, as he didn’t know, he got no
answer.</p>

<p>“I must be careful,” he thought, “it might be the
Policeman Dog’s lantern.”</p>

<p>So the old robber fox hid behind a tree and waited.
By and by, after a while, who should come along but a
firefly. My, how her little lantern flickered and flared in
the wind.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” said Danny Fox, “who’s afraid? I’m glad
it’s not the Policeman Dog!”</p>

<p>The little firefly kept on her way, for, of course, she
hadn’t heard Danny Fox thinking. As her little light had
disappeared in the darkness the old robber came out of
his hiding place.</p>

<p>Then off he started again for the henhouse.</p>

<p>By and by he reached the Old Barnyard. But just as
he crept around the Big Red Barn, Old Sic’em, the farmer’s
dog, looked out of his wooden house.</p>

<p>“Bow, wow!” he went, tugging at the chain which
kept him home nights in his little bungalow, “wow.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, can’t you,” whined Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“Get out!” snarled Old Sic’em. “I’ll call the farmer.”</p>

<p>Just then who should hop by in the moonlight but
Little Jack Rabbit on his way home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ll catch that little bunny,” thought the old
fox, sneaking around to the Big Red Barn.</p>

<p>“Now where is the old robber going?” the Weathercock
asked himself, as he swung to and fro on his gilded
toe.</p>

<p>He needn’t have asked that question, though, for just
then he spied Little Jack Rabbit and a second later, Danny
Fox.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear me!” thought the kind Weathercock, “I
don’t want that wicked fox to catch that nice little bunny.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>All of a sudden he remembered the radio. On top of
the Big Red Barn the Farmer’s Boy had fastened a set
of wires which led down to his little room in the loft.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello!” shouted the Weathercock. “Danny
Fox is after Little Jack Rabbit!”</p>

<p>The Farmer’s Boy must have heard him, for out of
bed he jumped to call through the transmitter:</p>

<p>“Danny Fox is after Little Jack Rabbit! Danny Fox
is out hunting!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” exclaimed the Policeman Dog, as the message
rang out in the Station House and, picking up his
club, off he started for the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>Just then a soft voice whispered from the treetop:</p>

<p>“Danny Fox is close to the heels of Little Jack
Rabbit.”</p>

<p>The dear little bunny was hopping down the forest
trail happy as could be. He didn’t know that close behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
was crafty Danny Fox. No, siree! He thought he
was safe enough. Why, he never had a thought of
danger.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be home with Mother,” he said to himself
when, all of a sudden—dear, dear! Will something
dreadful happen?</p>

<p>“Now I’ll get you!” snarled Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“No, not yet!” barked the Policeman Dog, swinging
his club. Whack! Down it came on the old fox’s head.</p>

<p>“Now, run!” shouted the Policeman Dog. And
maybe Little Jack Rabbit didn’t go! Why, he went so
fast that he left his shadow a mile behind him!</p>

<p>Then back to the Station House trotted the Policeman
Dog, leaving the sly fox to get home as best he could.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the little bunny was safe in the dear
Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Mother dear,” he said the next morning, “can’t I
have a radio outfit for my very own?”</p>

<p>“Call up the Three-in-One-Cent Store and find out
what it will cost,” she answered.</p>

<p>It took the little rabbit bunny boy just a minute or
three to call up</p>

<br>

<p>“Who’s Little Me?” asked a voice. Then, of course
the little rabbit had to explain who he was, whether it
looked like rain, and why the clover tops were not so red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>as last year. You see, the person in the Three-in-One-Cent
Store was a very curious person, always trying to find out
what was going on in the Shady Forest and the Sunny
Meadow. Maybe he had once been a country boy rabbit
before going into business at Rabbitville, U. S. A.</p>

<p>By and by he figured out what the cost of a radio
outfit would be.</p>

<p>“When do you want it installed?” he asked, which
means, set up.</p>

<p>“Wait till I ask mother,” answered the little bunny,
hopping into the kitchen where the pretty lady bunny was
making carrot cake and lollypop stew for supper.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear me!” she exclaimed, on learning that it
would cost 230 carrot cents. “You’d better call up your
Uncle Lucky. He’s rich enough to put in a dozen.
Maybe he’ll order one for you. I wish I had the money,”
and sweet Lady Love picked up her little boy rabbit and
kissed him three times, once on the left cheek, twice on
the right cheek and, last and best, on the mouth. “There
now, run along.”</p>

<p>So away he hopped back to the receiver to tell the rabbit
clerk at the Three-in-One-Cent Store that unless Uncle
Lucky supplied the money there’d be no radio at the little
white bungalow in the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Too bad, and yet not so worse. Your Uncle Lucky
is so fond of you that he might buy you a little Luckymobile
some day, pretty soon,” answered the clerk.</p>

<p>After saying good-by, Little Jack Rabbit asked Central
to give him:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In a moment Uncle Lucky shouted: “Hello, hello!
Who’s calling me?”</p>

<p>“Little Jack Rabbit,” answered the bunny boy, quick
as a wink. “I want a radio set, but I haven’t enough
money. All the other little boys are going to get one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if the radio set costs a million carrot
cents,” shouted dear Uncle Lucky over the telephone
when the bunny salesman at the Three-in-One-Cent Store
suggested that a radio outfit was rather expensive. “Nothing
is too good for my little nephew. Put it in right away
so that he can listen to David Cory’s stories.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot,” respectfully
answered the Three-in-One-Cent Store salesman, hanging

Bugle</em>. After luncheon he hopped out to the
garage and, telling the Old Red Rooster to weed the lettuce
patch, set out for Little Jack Rabbit’s bungalow.</p>

<p>“Dear me! He had gone only a little way, not so very
far, when something went wrong with the Luckymobile.
Dear me! again. By the time it was mended, Mr. Happy
Sun was nearly ready for bed. At last, however, dear
Uncle Lucky arrived at the Old Bramble Patch, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
old wedding stovepipe hat and blue silk polkadot handkerchief.
Honking the horn maybe a million times, less
or more, he hopped out and into the little kitchen where
Lady Love and her bunny boy were eating supper.</p>

<p>“Have you got any clover top pie?” asked the old
gentleman rabbit, hanging up his old wedding stovepipe
hat.</p>

<p>Of course Lady Love had. She had everything that
was good to eat, you may be sure.</p>

<p>As soon as the supper dishes were cleared away, the
three little rabbits hopped into the sitting room to hear
the victrola sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, early in the morning</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">To get an ice cream cone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Uncle Lucky, and he told a funny
story of a crab who, by walking backwards into an orchard,
made all the trees bear crab apples, which so provoked
the farmer that he boiled the crab and ate him for
supper.</p>

<p>By and by the little cuckoo began to sing from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
little clock house: “Time for bed, time for bed!” At once
the three little rabbits hopped upstairs, first blowing out
all the electric lights so that Hungry Hawk, who is always
looking for little mice and rabbits, wouldn’t be able
to see the little white bungalow.</p>

<p>And when everything was quiet a tiny fly asked Little
Miss Cricket:</p>

<p>“Is there any cheese in Lady Love’s cupboard?”</p>

<p>But the little cricket wouldn’t tell where Lady Love
kept all her good things and neither would I and neither
would the canary bird who was sound asleep with her
head under her wing.</p>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, Uncle Lucky
shouted over the ’phone: “Is this the Three-in-One Cent
Store? Don’t forget to put in Little Jack Rabbit’s radio
apparatus?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have it installed to-day—don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Let’s invite all our friends over to-night,” said Uncle
Lucky, turning to Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>In less than five hundred short seconds the two little
bunnies were speeding away. Pretty soon they saw
Squirrel Nutcracker on the doorstep of his Chestnut Tree
House.</p>

<p>“Come over to-night and listen in over our new radio,”
shouted the bunny boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, thank you!” replied the old squirrel.</p>

<p>Next, Busy Beaver said he’d come; also Sammy Skunk
and the Big Brown Bear. Then Uncle Lucky stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
at the Old Duck Pond to invite Granddaddy Bullfrog and
Taddy Tadpole.</p>

<p>“What’s all the noise about?” asked pretty Mrs. Oriole
from her stocking-like nest on the Old Willow Tree.</p>

<p>“Come over to my radio party to-night,” answered
Little Jack Rabbit, as he drove over to the Barnyard.</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” crowed Cocky Doodle.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” said Goosey Lucy.</p>

<p>“I won’t be a second late,” promised Turkey Tim.</p>

<p class="no-indent">sounded the wake-up song of the musical alarm clock.</p>

<p>Out of bed hopped Little Jack Rabbit and in a few
minutes he was ready for breakfast—nice carrot porridge
with lettuce cream, turnip toast and a stewed lollypop.
After he had polished the front door knob, fed the canary
and filled with kindling the woodbox behind the kitchen
stove, he kissed Lady Love good-by.</p>

<p>“Do be careful!” cautioned his pretty bunny mother,
smoothing the blue bow at his little white throat. “Do be
careful. Danny Fox is everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” answered the little rabbit bunny boy,
and away he hopped down the winding path through the
brambles. Pretty soon he came to the Sunny Meadow,
through which the Bubbling Brook gurgled and laughed
until it splashed into the Old Duck Pond.</p>

<p>The Sunny Meadow was brown and barren. No lovely
flowers smiled at the little rabbit as he hopped along. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” answered the happy little rabbit, politely.
“I’ll go right down to the Three-in-One Cent Store
for a lollypop ice-cream cone.”</p>

<p>On the way he heard Squirrel Nutcracker scolding
Chatterbox, his red squirrel cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired the little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Nothing but trouble,” replied the old gray squirrel.
“Chatterbox tried to steal into my store house.”</p>

<p>“I did not!” answered the little Red Squirrel. “I only
peeked in through a knot hole.”</p>

<p>“Let’s play a game of tag! You’re it!” shouted the
bunny boy, clapping his paw on Chatterbox’s shoulder.</p>

<p>My, what a scamper after that! Over the fallen logs,
across the Bubbling Brook and under the Old Rail Fence
raced these three little people until, all of a sudden, they
almost bumped into the Billy Goat Stage Coach.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” cried the Old Dog Driver, pulling in the
billy goats right in front of the little bunny. “Stand still,
Butter! Quiet now, Bouncer!”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m in,” called out the little rabbit, looking
up through the open window at the good bow-wow
driver.</p>

<p>“Gid-ap!” shouted the Old Dog, clicking his tongue
on his long white teeth, and cracking his whip over the
heads of his prancing billy goats.</p>

<p>Away went the Billy Goat Stage Coach, rattlety bang,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
over the bumps and over the stones till it almost crackled
the bunny boy’s bones.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the Old Dog Driver shouted:</p>

<p>“Carrot City—Next stop, Turnip Town!”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait!” squeaked an old lady Pig, waving a
green umbrella.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” growled the Old Dog, “I’m five minutes
behind time.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the breathless lady
Pig, as the polite little rabbit latched the coach door.</p>

<p>“Turnip Town, m’am,” he answered, opening his
knapsack to slip in his little red-striped candy cane.</p>

<p>“Going for a visit?” enquired the inquisitive lady Pig.</p>

<p>“No, m’am,” replied the little rabbit. “Just going for
a candy chocolate mouse.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, the peppermint cat might catch it,” said
the lady Pig with a squeaky chuckle.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” sighed the little bunny, “is she as fierce as
the farmer’s black cat?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” answered the talkative lady Pig.</p>

<p>Just then the coach stopped and in hopped Daddy
Longlegs. He wore a long linen duster and carried a
cotton umbrella on his arm.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” he exclaimed, “if my dear little
friend isn’t on board.” And, sitting down by the little
bunny, he enquired all about the folks at home.</p>

<p>“Mother’s well,” answered the little rabbit. “She always
wears two pink roses, one on each cheek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“How’s Uncle Lucky?”</p>

<p>“Turnip Town!” all of a sudden shouted the Old Dog
Driver, and out jumped the little rabbit boy to buy his
chocolate mouse.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” he sighed, as he hopped out of the candy
shop, “I must hurry home,” and away he went, clipperty
clip, lipperty lip to the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>By and by, not so very far, a dreadful howl sounded
close at hand. Dear me! before poor little Jack Rabbit
could hop away somebody grabbed him by the throat.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha! Now I’ve got you!” chuckled a deep,
growly voice, and Mr. Wicked Wolf dropped the little
frightened bunny boy into a big empty gunny sack.
Then, throwing it over his shoulder, he started off for his
den in the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” again chuckled Mr. Wicked Wolf,
“what a nice dinner Mrs. Wolf and I will have to-night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” thought the little rabbit, “mother will
never again see her little bunny boy come hopping up the
path in the Old Bramble Patch.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” chuckled Mr. Wolf, as he hurried along
with the poor little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” cried the poor little bunny boy, all alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in the sack on the back of the big wicked wolf, “what
shall I do, what shall I do? I’m a goner. Yes, I’m a

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Poor Little Jack Rabbit! all alone—in the sack—on
the back—of Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<p>Just then a little voice from the treetop whispered:
“Haven’t you a knife in your pocket, little rabbit?”</p>

<p>It was Bobbie Redvest’s voice, so low and sweet that
Mr. Wicked Wolf, who was old and deaf, never heard a
word.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” thought the little rabbit, all a-tremble,
his little knees going clitter, clatter and his little heart pitter,
patter, “I wonder if I have?” And he looked through
his pockets one by one, his little pink nose trembling with
fright just like a star on a frosty night. At last, oh joy!
and a catch of his breath; he found his knife in the little
handkerchief pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Then he waited all alone—in the sack—on the back—of
Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<p>There! It came again, the little voice from the treetop:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cut a hole—in the sack—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Oh, so care-ful-ly!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p>All a-tremble, the little rabbit opened his knife and
made a slit in the bag, oh, so qui-et-ly.</p>

<p>Then, thrusting out his head, he was just going to hop
away, when the little voice from the treetop whispered:</p>

<p>“Wait—a—minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” thought the little rabbit, “I don’t want
to wait. I want to get away.” But he minded the little
voice, and it was mighty well he did, for just then Mr.
Wicked Wolf stopped short and said, “Gee whiskers, I’m
getting tired. I guess I’ll sit down on this old log.” And
down he sat, letting the sack slip to the ground. Taking
out his old corncob, he filled it with tobacco and, scratching
a match on his furry trouser leg, commenced to smoke.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance!” whispered the little voice from
the treetop.</p>

<p>Out jumped the little rabbit, but as he was about to
hop away, oh, dear me! again the little voice from the
treetop whispered:</p>

<p>“Wait—a—minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” sighed the little bunny, “I don’t want to
wait. I want to get away!” But he minded the little voice
from the treetop.</p>

<p>“Pick up—that stone—and slip—it in—the sack—oh,—so—care-ful-ly.”</p>

<p>And the little rabbit, all a-tremble, his little heart a-pitter-patter
and his little knees a-clitter-clatter, picked up
the stone and slipped it in the sack, oh, so care-ful-ly.</p>

<p>“Wait—a—minute!” whispered the little voice for the
third time, as he was about to hop away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh, oh!” sighed the little bunny, looking over
his shoulder at Mr. Wicked Wolf’s hairy back, “if I wait
another minute I’ll never get away.” But he minded the
little voice from the treetop.</p>

<p>“Pin up the slit—in the sack—with three—pine needle—pins,”
whispered the little voice. All a-tremble, the
poor, distracted little rabbit hunted on the ground under
the big pine tree until he found the three little pins. Then,
oh, so, care-ful-ly, he pinned up the slit in the sack.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance!” whispered the little voice.
“Hide!”</p>

<p>The next minute the little rabbit had hopped behind a
tree. Buttoning up his pretty white fur overcoat so that
it wouldn’t show around the trunk and drawing together
the tips of his little ears, he waited, oh, so anxiously, for
maybe just a minute or three.</p>

<p>“Guess I’m rested now!” said Mr. Wicked Wolf,
knocking the ashes from his pipe and slipping it in his
pocket. Then, drawing the sack up on his shoulder, he
started off for home.</p>

<p>“My, what a heavy little bunny you are!” he growled,
as he trotted through the woods.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he jumped over the Bubbling Brook. But
when he landed on the other side,</p>

<p>“Oh, my! What a tough little rabbit you are! But
wait till I get you home! Mrs. Wolf will stew you until
you’re nice and soft and tender! Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Hey, mother,” he shouted, on reaching his little stone
house on the wooded hillside, “I have a nice little rabbit
for supper.”</p>

<p>Letting the sack slip to the ground, Mr. Wicked Wolf
untied it, oh, so care-ful-ly! But, goodness gracious
me! When he peeked in and saw a big stone instead of a
tender little rabbit, wasn’t he angry?</p>

<p>Shoving in his paw, he pulled out the stone and hurled
it across the Sunny Meadow. Whack! it came up against
the old apple tree, knocking off twenty big red apples,
which almost hit Little Jack Rabbit as he hopped safely
back to the dear Old Bramble Patch, where Lady Love,
his pretty bunny mother, stood waiting for her little boy
at the gate in the old picket fence.</p>

<p>“Cousin Cottontail has invited us over this evening
to hear the Jack Rabbit Man tell stories,” she said, kissing
her little bunny boy.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! That will be fine!” cried the little bunny,
forgetting all about Mr. Wicked Wolf. Dear me, I wish
that wicked wolf had forgotten all about the little rabbit.
Then, with a skip and jump, he hopped on the porch.</p>

<p>“Hello, little rabbit boy,” twittered the canary from
her gold cage. “What makes you so happy?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear what mother just said?” he asked,
with a twinkle of his pretty pink nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“No,” answered the pretty yellow bird. “What did
she say?”</p>

<p>“That we are invited over to Cousin Cottontail’s to
listen on the radio.”</p>

<p>Just then something happened. Isn’t it a shame that
unpleasant things so often happen?</p>

<p>“No, you’re not going to hear bunny stories to-night,”
growled a deep ugly voice, and there, just outside the Old
Bramble Patch, stood Mr. Wicked Wolf. Dear me!
How cruel he looked, his big red tongue hanging out of
his mouth and his long sharp teeth gleaming like bowie
knives in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“What—what are you here for?” asked the little rabbit,
all a-tremble.</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” snarled the ugly beast. “I’ll wait
here for you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, please don’t wait!” cried the frightened little
rabbit.</p>

<p>“Gr-r-r!” growled the big ferocious animal; “I’d like
to eat you. I would, if I could only break through into
the Old Bramble Patch.”</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit didn’t wait to hear more. Quickly
taking down the canary cage, he hopped one, two, three,
go! into his little bungalow.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother!” he shouted, skip-toeing into the
kitchen, “something dreadful is going to happen to-night.
Mr. Wicked Wolf is waiting outside.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” cried the anxious lady bunny.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall we do? I declare, I wish
your father wouldn’t go away on business so often.”</p>

<p>“How will we hear the bunny stories to-night?” asked
the little rabbit.</p>

order and all you could hear was a dreadful buzzing like
a million bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Well, if I’m not mad clear through and through,” said
Lady Love. “The idea of Mr. Wicked Wolf spoiling our
evening. I believe he’s done something to the telephone
wire,” and the ex-as-per-ated lady bunny again took down
the receiver. Then, all of a sudden, she hopped over to the
electric drop-light and, unscrewing the silk cord connection,
placed it against the telephone.</p>

<p>Goodness me! What a howl of pain came from the
outskirts of the Old Bramble Patch. With a laugh, Lady
Love hopped over to the back porch and pointed to Mr.
Wicked Wolf limping across the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>“He had pulled down my telephone wire,” cried the
lady bunny, “but he let go when I gave him a shock of
electricity. Ha, ha! I guess he won’t trouble us any more
this evening.” Then putting on her little sunny bonnet
with the pinky roses on it, she and Little Jack Rabbit
hopped over to Cousin Cottontail’s house.</p>

<p>Little Jack Rabbit looked out of the tiny white bungalow
in the Old Bramble Patch. The rain was falling
and the Sunny Meadow wasn’t the least bit sunny. No, indeed.
The Bubbling Brook was making a great fuss as it
rushed along, sometimes overflowing its banks and making
little lakes in the hollow spaces.</p>

<p>“Ker dunk! ker dunk!” croaked Granddaddy Bullfrog
from his log in the Old Duck Pond. He didn’t mind
the rain. His rubber coat kept him nice and dry. As for
his shoes, I guess he’d never outgrown his boyhood’s delight
in bare legs.</p>

<p>Down from the Farmyard waddled Duckey Waddles
on his big wide wabbly yellow feet. He loved the wet
weather, oh, my yes. Pretty soon he went in for a swim,
now and then, and sometimes oftener, standing on his head
in the water to catch a little minnow.</p>

<p>“Quack, quack!” he shouted in answer to Granddaddy
Bullfrog’s solemn “Ker dunk, ker dunk!”</p>

<p>Up at the Farmyard Cocky Doodle, Henny Jenny,
Goosey Lucy and Turkey Tim stood out of the wet under
the old cowshed, wondering how long Mr. Merry Sun
would hide behind the gray rain clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>On the top of the Big Red Barn the weathercock
turned to and fro on his gilded toe, for Billy Breeze was
blowing across the open spaces, now sending the clouds
helter-skelter over the sky, now bending the dripping
bushes or shaking the raindrops from the apple trees.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d let me point to the West,” sighed the
Weathercock. “Then it would soon clear up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” answered Billy Breeze, and all of a
sudden he blew away a dark cloud and out came Mr.
Merry Sun with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted the Weathercock, swinging about
on his toe to point to the West. “Now we’ll have a beautiful
day.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” laughed Little Jack Rabbit, hopping out
of his pretty white bungalow and down the narrow path
through the rough brambles to the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>Just then who should come along but Timmie Meadowmouse.
My, but he was glad to see the lovely sunshine.</p>

<p>“Howdy! Have you heard the news?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What news?” asked the little rabbit, curiously, thinking,
“Goodness me! Something dreadful has happened,”
as he twinked his little pink nose and winked his two big
pink eyes.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the tiny meadowmouse, “you make me so
dizzy, I can’t think.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the little rabbit, “but hurry. I’m
afraid something has happened to Chippy Chipmunk or
the Big Brown Bear.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered Timmie Meadowmouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
taking off his little fur cap. All of a sudden, quick as a
flash, or a smash or a dash, down from the sky swooped
Hungry Hawk.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted the little rabbit, hopping under a
bush. But, dear me! The tiny meadowmouse was just a
second too late. The next minute up in the air he went,
held tightly in the cruel claws of the old hawk.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” shouted poor frightened Timmie Meadowmouse,
as higher and higher flew the big feathered
robber until pretty soon he looked like a tiny speck in the
sky.</p>

<p>“How can I save my little friend?” cried the unhappy
bunny boy. But nobody answered him, not even Billy
Breeze, who is such a good friend to all the little people
of the Shady Forest and the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>The anxious little rabbit looked this way and that way,
but all he could see was a tiny speck in the blue sky as
the old robber bird flew swiftly away.</p>

<p>Just then the bunny boy noticed another speck in the
sky, only larger and of a different shape.</p>

<p>“What is that?” he asked himself, hoping it might be
the kind American Eagle who had once befriended him.</p>

<p>But no, it was not. No, indeed, it was something very,
very different. Oh, my, yes, I should say so.</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by standing still
on the Sunny Meadow, the dis-con-so-late (which means
hopelessly unhappy, little readers) bunny boy rabbit
hopped away until, all of a sudden, just like that, he almost
bumped into the Farmer’s Boy, who was holding a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
long string that rose up and up and up into the air until
it ended in a queer shaped something with a long tail that
swung to and fro as Billy Breeze laughed and whistled
across the white cloud meadows of the sky.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, Little Jack Rabbit almost bumped into the
Farmer’s Boy. You see, the little bunny, looking up into
the sky as he hopped along, had paid little attention to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed the Farmer’s Boy. “Your eyes
are filled with tears. What’s the matter, little rabbit?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” cried the little bunny. “Hungry
Hawk has carried off little Timmie Meadowmouse.”</p>

<p>“Where to?” asked the Farmer’s Boy, curiously.</p>

<p>“Do you see that little speck?” asked the sorrowful little
rabbit, pointing upward.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Farmer’s Boy. “Just to the right
of my kite. Yes, I see it.”</p>

<p>“That’s Hungry Hawk,” sobbed the little bunny boy.
“He has Timmie Meadowmouse in his claws.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” answered the Farmer’s Boy, and then, all
of a sudden, he started to run across the Sunny Meadow,
pulling in the kite string at the same time. For a moment
Little Jack Rabbit was too surprised to move. Then
away he hopped after the Farmer’s Boy. You see, the little
bunny was so sorry for the poor little mouse that he
forgot all about his fear of the Farmer’s Boy. Yes, indeed,
that’s what sorrow does sometimes, and maybe
oftener. When we are sorry for some one else we often
forget our own troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>By the time the little rabbit had caught up to the Farmer’s
Boy there was a great commotion going on ’way
up in the big blue sky. Oh, my, yes. I tell you what,
that Farmer’s Boy was a clever fellow. He hadn’t lived
on a farm all his life for nothing. No, indeed. He had
taught himself things which the old schoolmaster never
dreamed of as he sat at his desk in the little red school
house on the hill, where the children’s feet were never
still. My, how strangely that boy behaved! Suddenly he
would dash off to the right, then away to the left; then
backward, next forward, sometimes letting out the string,
or winding it up again.</p>

<p>“What is he doing?” thought the little bunny boy,
gazing up into the sky at the big kite, which seemed only
a trifle larger than Hungry Hawk. Oh, dear, I’m so worried
for fear that poor little mouse will be eaten by that
dreadful old robber bird.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Farmer’s Boy, with a yell of delight,
started to run backward as fast as he could go. “I’ve
got you! I’ve got you!” he kept shouting, as he pulled
in the kite, hand over hand.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Little Jack Rabbit, all
a-tremble, hopping about on one leg.</p>

<p>“I’ve caught the old hawk in my kite! I’m pulling
him down, you betcher!” answered the Farmer’s Boy, as
he carefully pulled in the string hand over hand, taking
care to keep the string taut lest by a sudden slip backward
the kite might untangle itself from the struggling bird.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
As the good home-made, brown paper kite slowly descended
the little rabbit boy could make out the figure of
Hungry Hawk pressed tight against the frame, his wings
entangled in the face-strings.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the Farmer’s Boy. “If I only had
four hands and my gun along, I’d shoot the old bird from
here.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t,” cried the little bunny boy rabbit.
“You might hit Timmie Meadowmouse.”</p>

<p>“Like enough. Never thought about it,” answered
the Farmer’s Boy. “Mebbe it’s just as well the old gun
is home.”</p>

<p>By this time the kite was just overhead. Billy Breeze
was helping all he could. He blew hard and strong, with
a steady pressure, keeping the big brown paper kite from
dipping. Maybe he was laughing at the old robber bird!
Just then a little black figure dropped on a pile of hay on
the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>“It’s Timmie Meadowmouse!” shouted the little bunny
boy, but the Farmer’s Boy was so intent on his job he
never turned his head. No, siree. He had all he could
do to manage the kite. Frantically beating his wings, the
old hawk wiggled and jiggled, this way and that, vainly
trying to free himself from the clinging tied-together
pieces of rags that formed the rudder to the big brown
kite.</p>

<p>But, dear me! Just as the Farmer’s Boy reached up
to grasp the fierce bird, either Billy Breeze forgot himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
or the good old kite could stand the strain no longer,
or something gave way, a string or two, maybe a knot.
All of a sudden, with a wiggle and jiggle, Hungry Hawk
slipped out and sailed away, up and up, across the Big
Red Barn to the freedom of the open sky.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news?” asked the Old Brown

<p>“What news?” enquired Little Jack Rabbit, hopping
along with the friendly steed under the warm rays of Mr.
Merry Sun in the Big Blue Sky.</p>

<p>“Why, the circus is at Turnip City,” answered the
Old Brown Horse. “The Circus Elephant, the funny
clowns, and the roller skating bears.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” exclaimed the little rabbit. “I want to
see them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’ve never been to the circus!”
whinnied the good Old Horse. “Well, you’ve got a

up he hopped to call dear Uncle Lucky on the telephone:</p>

<p>“Listen, Uncle Lucky! I’m hiring the Billy Goat

explained Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come over with a bushel of passes,” answered
the dear generous old gentleman bunny. “What
time do you go?”</p>

<p>“At seven o’clock to-morrow morning. We must get
an early start,” answered Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Now, whom shall we invite?” he enquired, turning
to his small bunny son, who was hopping about, so happy
to know he was going to the circus to see the animals and
the clowns, and maybe a monkey and a bear and a Mexican
dog without any hair.</p>

<p>“Whom shall we invite?” repeated Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“All your friends and all my friends, and maybe some
more,” answered the bunny boy with a hop, skip and jump
out on the porch of the little white house in the Old Bramble
Patch.</p>

<p>Just then the little canary bird in her gold cage began
to twitter:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I’m not discontented,” replied the little bunny boy,
“I’m happy. Father is going to take me to the circus,”
and he hopped down the path through the bramble bushes.</p>

<p>“Timmie Meadowmouse, Timmie Meadowmouse!”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked the tiny mouse, peeking
out of his little round house of woven grass.</p>

<p>“Want to go to the circus? Father is going to hire the
Billy Goat Stage. We start at 7 to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be up bright and early,” answered Timmie Meadowmouse,
darting back into his little house to get out his
best Sunday-go-to-meeting suit.</p>

<p>“Timmie Meadowmouse will go,” cried Little Jack
Rabbit, hopping back into the house.</p>

<p>“Nobody will refuse, I imagine,” laughed Lady Love.
“Whom else have you invited?”</p>

<p>“I’m going over to the Barnyard,” answered Little
Jack Rabbit. “I’ll invite everybody I meet,” and off he
hopped. By and by, after a while, but not nearly a mile,
he spied Granddaddy Bullfrog on his big log near the
bank of the Old Duck Pond.</p>

<p>“Oh, Granddaddy Bullfrog! Father is going to hire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the Billy Goat Stage Coach to take us all to the circus
to-morrow morning. We start at 7, right after breakfast.
Will you come along?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” answered the old frog. “I haven’t
been to the circus for a long time. Hurrah! I’ll be a kid
again and eat a ton of peanuts—maybe!”</p>

<p>“Be at the Old Bramble Patch on time,” shouted the
little rabbit, who by this time was half across the Sunny
Meadow on his merry way.</p>

<p>“Will you come?” asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” answered the nice lady goose. “Don’t

<p>“Where is he?” asked the bunny boy, looking here
and there and everywhere.</p>

<p>“He went for a swim in the Old Duck Pond,” answered
Henny Jenny.</p>

<p>“Why, I just came from there,” replied the little bunny.
“I didn’t see him. I saw only Granddaddy Bullfrog.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see him now,” quacked a familiar voice,
and there stood Ducky Waddles himself. He had just
waddled around from behind the Big Red Barn.</p>

<p>“Will you come to my circus party?” asked Little Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t refuse,” laughed the nice little duck.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder next who will be invited to the Circus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Listen, and you shall hear, for the little bunny has just
hopped around the Big Haystack.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cow, won’t you come to the circus?”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” enquired that nice lady cow, whipping
her tail to and fro to scare away the flies. “I can’t go far
for my little baby calf needs me ’most all the time.”</p>

<p>“At Turnip City,” answered Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! You must excuse me,” replied Mrs. Cow.
“That’s too far away. I’ll wait for Uncle Lucky’s Circus
to come to Rabbitville. But thank you, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Now, who else?” thought the little bunny, when, all
of a sudden, he spied Turkey Tim.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come to my circus party?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the big turkey gobbler.
“What time, and where, and how?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning at seven o’clock we all go in
the Billy Goat Stage Coach. Be on time at the Old Bramble
Patch,” and away hopped Little Jack Rabbit, his long
ears catching the turkey gobbler’s poetry answer:</p>

in his gray fur suit, sitting on a tree stump in the Shady
Forest.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t you be glad when you hear what I’m going
to say,” laughed the rabbit boy.</p>

his hind legs. “It’s a whole year since I’ve been to the
circus.”</p>

<p>“Well then, be at the Old Bramble Patch to-morrow
morning at seven,” replied the little bunny, and away he
went, clipperty clip, lipperty lip, up the winding trail to
the cave of the Big Brown Bear.</p>

<p class="no-indent">shouted the old Professor Bird looking out of his window
as the bunny boy knocked on the tiny door in the Tall
Pine Tree.</p>

<p>“I don’t need Dr. Quack, the famous duck doctor,” he
answered. “I’m giving a circus party. Won’t you and
Mrs. Crow and Blackie Crow come? We start to-morrow
morning at seven right after breakfast from the Old
Bramble Patch. The Billy Goat Stage Coach will take us
all to Turnip City where the circus people are giving a
show. I’m sure little Blackie will love to go.”</p>

<p>“We all will,” answered Professor Crow. “It makes
me feel young again just to think of it. Thank you.
We’ll be on time.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CIRCUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Goodness gracious me! That Billy Goat Stage Coach
will be dreadfully crowded if Little Jack Rabbit invites
many more friends to his circus party. Of course, when
you come to think it over, the birds can perch on the roof
and the little animals crawl under the seats; maybe one or
two might sit with the stage coach driver, the nice Old Dog
who smokes a big pipe while holding the reins in his left
paw and the whip in his right. Oh, he’s a good driver, so
kind and gentle that the billy goat team will do anything
for him.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I mustn’t forget a single friend,” thought
the little rabbit, as he hopped over the Bubbling Brook
and across the Sunny Meadow to the Old Brush Heap.</p>

<p>Up the well-worn little path he hurried, clipperty clip,
lipperty lip, to Cousin Cottontail’s little bungalow under
the trailing green vines.</p>

<p>“Cousin Cottontail,” he shouted, “where are you?”</p>

<p>“We’re here,” came the answer, and out popped all
the little cottontails, one after another—five in all, their
pink noses twinkling like so many little stars.</p>

<p>“I’m giving a circus party to-morrow,” said Little
Jack Rabbit. “Want to come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Gracious me! I don’t see why he thought it necessary
to ask five little bunnies if they wanted to go to the
circus!</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” they all shouted at once, which
brought Mrs. Cottontail to the door to find out what all
the noise was about.</p>

<p>“What time do you start?” she asked.</p>

<p>“At seven to-morrow morning. We all go in the Billy
Goat Stage Coach,” explained Little Jack Rabbit.
“Please be on time, for if we don’t get an early start we
may not reach Turnip City in time to see the Grand Parade
of all the Queer People.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be over bright and early,” promised Mrs. Cottontail.
“Don’t you worry about us. Maybe some of
your other friends will keep you waiting, but not your old
auntie.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon she brought out an apronful of nice cookies,
just hot out of the oven.</p>

<p>Oh, what a nice feast all the little rabbits had! Nor
did they forget to save the crumbs for Bobbie Redvest,
who happened to pass by later on.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I must be going,” sighed Little Jack
Rabbit, when the last cookie was gone. “Mother will
worry if I’m late for supper.” And away he hopped, clipperty
clip, lipperty lip, down the little path under the Big
Brush Heap and across the Pleasant Meadow to the
Bubbling Brook, over which he hopped to the Sunny
Meadow. At last he was safe home in the dear Old
Bramble Patch, eating a nice supper of stewed lollypops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>It seemed to him that he had hardly jumped into bed
and fallen asleep when:</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang the cuckoo bird from her pretty clock house.</p>

<p>Out of bed hopped Lady Love and Mr. Rabbit; off

eating a breakfast of lollypop porridge, turnip tea and
carrot cakes with maple syrup.</p>

<p class="no-indent">all of a sudden barked the Old Dog Driver atop the Billy

<p>“Wait a minute,” begged Grandmother Magpie.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” panted the Big Brown Bear.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” called out Granddaddy Bullfrog.</p>

<p>“I’m on time,” laughed Cousin Cottontail, with her
five little bunnies hopping after her.</p>

<p>“Who said I was late?” cackled Henny Jenny.</p>

<p>“Good morning, I’m here,” said Turkey Tim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Is there room enough for me?” asked Timmie Meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“I’ll sit on top,” sang Bobbie Redvest.</p>

<p>“So will I,” said Squirrel Nutcracker.</p>

<p>“And that’s where I’ll sit,” said pretty Mrs. Oriole.</p>

<p>“I was nearly late,” cried Cocky Doodle.</p>

<p>“Let me squeeze in,” crowed the Old Red Rooster.</p>

<p>“Don’t step on us,” chirped the Three Little Grasshoppers.</p>

<p>“Nor on me,” squeaked little Miss Cricket.</p>

<p>“Hold on, I’m getting in,” barked the Yellow Dog
Tramp.</p>

<p>“I ran all the way,” panted Busy Beaver.</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Chippy Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“Any more?” asked the Old Dog Driver.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” shouted dear Uncle Lucky. “I’m going,”
and the dear old gentleman rabbit hopped out of his
Luckymobile and into the Stage Coach.</p>

<p>“I guess everybody’s here,” said Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Who’s that coming across the meadows?” asked the
lady bunny, looking out of the stage coach window.</p>

<p>“Why, bless my pink tie and horseshoe pin,” exclaimed
Uncle Lucky, “it’s Goosey Lucy.”</p>

<p>As soon as she was aboard, the Old Dog Driver
cracked his whip and away they went to Turnip City to
see Uncle Lucky’s wonderful circus.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” shouted the Old Dog Driver, pulling in his
team of billy goats. “Whoa!” and this time he said it so
loud that an old duck waddled out of a little house close
to the bridge gate.</p>

<p>“My gracious!” she quacked, “you have a load, all
right. I never saw so many animals and birds in a stage
coach before, and I’m an old duck. Oh, yes, I’m as old as
a good many great-great-grandmothers.”</p>

<p>“What is the toll?” asked the Old Dog Driver, lighting
his pipe and puffing out a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>“Five carrot cents for the stage coach, ten carrot cents
for the Billy Goat Team, two carrot cents for yourself,
and three carrot cents for each passenger,” answered the
old lady duck.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” whined the Old Dog Driver, “it will take
some time to count it all up. How will a lettuce leaf dollar
bill suit you?”</p>

<p>“Won’t do,” answered the old lady duck. My, wasn’t
she particular, though?</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s start counting,” sighed the Old Dog
Driver. “You count those on top and I’ll count those inside,
and who gets done first, wins.”</p>

<p>“Wins what?” asked the old Lady Duck.</p>

<p>“A Little Jack Rabbit Book,” laughed the Old Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Driver. “I have one in my pocket for your little grand
duckling. Hurry up and win.”</p>

<p>Then, goodness me! How that lady duck did count!
In less than five hundred short seconds she had finished
and the Old Dog Driver had only just begun.</p>

<p>Well, sir, when it came to pay, the toll was more than a
lettuce leaf dollar bill. Dear me, yes. But what it was I
won’t bother to tell you, for I haven’t had time to count
the passengers. Have you?</p>

<p>As soon as the toll gate swung open, over the bridge,
pranced the billy goats, rapperty rap, rapperty rap, and
before very long they were galloping up a steep hill, for
those billy goats didn’t mind that. No, siree! They
were used to climbing mountains and, besides, everybody
was singing:</p>

<p>My goodness! how that Billy Goat Coach rolled over
the pebbles and over the stones. And how those billy goats
pranced and threw out their heels, shook their heads and
their long horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Gid-ap!” barked the Old Dog Driver.</p>

<p>“Let ’er go!” shouted dear Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>Away, faster than ever, and faster still, went the billy
goats up the big steep hill, and down the other side to Rabbitville.</p>

<p>Along Lettuce Avenue they clattered, past the Three-in-One
Cent Store, past the Welsh Rarebit Club and the
Post Office, from the doorway of which the Old Maid
Grasshopper waved a white pocket handkerchief; past the
Old Mill where the Dusty Moth Miller ground the corn
for the farmer bunnies; past the house of Dr. Quack, the
famous duck doctor, and the little green house in which
Mrs. Mouse lived.</p>

<p>Dear me! I could go on and on just like the old coach,
and say so much that I’d have no room to put in what happened
when it finally drew up in Turnip City.</p>

<p>“Whoa there, my good little billy goats!” shouted the
Old Dog Driver, as the big Policeman Dog held up his
paw to stop the taxis and wagons until everybody was safe
on the sidewalk. Then the Old Dog Driver gave the
billy goats a nice drink of water at the fountain and drove
around to the wagon entrance on Cabbage Street.</p>

<p>Well, it didn’t take the Shady Forest and Sunny
Meadow people long to walk into the tent. Uncle Lucky
headed the procession, Little Jack Rabbit next, then
Grandma Bunny and Lady Love, Mr. Rabbit and the Big
Brown Bear, until, way down at the end, waddled Ducky
Waddles.</p>

<p>“Quack, quack! Please hurry!” he begged, beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to fear the circus would be over by the time he entered
the tent.</p>

<p>But he needn’t have worried, for the Old Dog Driver
had arrived early.</p>

<p>“Come on, Timmie Meadowmouse,” cried the little
bunny, “I must see the animals.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to a little tent. They didn’t
know it belonged to the Circus Queen, the lovely lady
dressed in gauze and gold spangles, who rode on the big
white horse.</p>

<p>There she sat on a circus trunk, holding in her arms
a little baby.</p>

dreaming? Maybe I’m in By-low Land!”</p>

<p>“No, m’am,” answered the little bunny, taking off his

<p>Sure enough, a man’s voice was shouting, “Liz, oh,
Liz! Liz, Liz!”</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” answered the Circus Queen, tenderly
placing the sleeping baby in its cradle.</p>

<p>Just outside stood a big white horse, and before the little
bunny could say “Oh! Ah!” she was riding into the
big tent. “Hurrah! Hurray! Here’s Lizzie Gray, she’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
riding better every day!” clapped and shouted all the people.</p>

<p>But nobody knew she was a loving mother nor that
just outside in the little tent slept Boy Blue.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the band struck up and a funny clown
began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Uncle Lucky’s Big Star Show,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After that the big parade went around the ring, pretty
girls dressed up as butterflies, elephants gayly decorated
with diamond chains, camels carrying gorgeously gowned
ladies, big floats with funny little dwarfs. Everything
you can think of, and lots of things you’d never dream of.</p>

<p>My, wasn’t it fun. Well, I guess yes three times, and
maybe four. I’m sure I can’t count, I’m so excited just
writing about the circus.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Little Jack Rabbit. “There’s the
circus Queen!”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted the Big Brown Bear, and the next
minute he shouted it three times for the trained bear had
begun to roller skate.</p>

Granddaddy Bullfrog, he hip-hurrayed until he grew so
husky that he didn’t make a sound when he opened his
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>By and by, after a while, the show ended and Little
Jack Rabbit’s Circus Party marched out and into the Billy
Goat Stage Coach.</p>

<p>“Good-by, come again next year!” cried the big Policeman
Dog on the street corner.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” answered Uncle Lucky, waving his
old wedding stovepipe hat. “We’ll be back inside a year,
see you keep the crossing clear; let no taxi run us down
when we come to Turnip Town.”</p>

<p>Then away rattled the stage coach, the two little billy
goats prancing up Lettuce Avenue as gayly as you please.</p>

<p>“Toot, toot!” went the ferryboat whistle, as it neared
the river. “Hurry up!” it seemed to say. So the Old Dog
Driver cracked his whip over the heads of the billy goats
and in a few minutes all were on board.</p>

<p>“Tinkle, tinkle!” sounded the bell, the big paddle
wheels commenced to turn, and in less time than I can take
to tell it the ferryboat was half across the River Sippi, and
almost before dear Uncle Lucky could get his shoes shined
it bumped into the ferry slip.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! Here we are!” exclaimed the dear
old gentleman rabbit, when the Billy Goat Stage Coach at
last drew up before the Old Bramble Patch;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the coach was empty and as soon as
the little people of the forest and meadow had thanked
Little Jack Rabbit for a good time, they either hopped or
ran or flew to their homes. Pretty soon there was nobody
left, so the happy rabbit family hopped into the little white
house in the Old Bramble Patch. In a few minutes the
nice old lady bunny and Lady Love had prepared a nice
hot supper.</p>

<p>“I declare,” exclaimed Uncle Lucky, setting down his
cup of hot turnip tea, “that certainly was the best circus
I’ve been to in many a year.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world,” agreed Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“What do you know about circuses, you little bunny?”
laughed the funny old gentleman rabbit. “This is the first
time you’ve ever been to one.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” answered the little bunny.

are very real.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me of a story,” mused dear Uncle
Lucky, pushing up his spectacles and settling himself
comfortably in the old arm chair:</p>

<p>“Once upon a time a little bird in a blue coat sat on an
Old Snake Fence. All around him the earth was dingy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
the trees bare and leafless. The chilly wind kept little
patches of snow still lingering in the shady hollow places.
But all this didn’t keep the brave little bird from whistling
merrily, for in his heart he held a dream of summer, red
roses and green woods, grassy meadows and little hills covered
with wild strawberries.</p>

<p>“So he sang his song of promise to his mate while she
made a comfortable nest in a dry hole in a fence post. By
and by, when it was finished, she filled it with pretty eggs,
on which she sat to warm them with her feathers. And
while she sat there she, too, dreamed—dreamed of four
little bluebirds.</p>

<p>“As the sun grew warmer and the meadow greener and
the forest more leafy, one by one the little bluebirds broke
open the shells.</p>

<h2>BUNNY TALE 10<br>
<span class="fs80">THE CIRCUS ELEPHANT</span></h2>

<p>For days nobody talked of anything but the Circus
party. From bush and tree in the Shady Forest, from hollow
and hill in the Sunny Meadow, the Little Feathered
and Fourfooted Folk were telling over and over again the
wonderful things they had seen at the circus.</p>


<p>“Gracious me,” chuckled the Big Brown Bear, “that
cousin of mine certainly can roller skate.”</p>


<p>“Well, he was no better than my relative who flew
through the ring of flames,” cried Professor Jim Crow.</p>


<p>“Nor any braver than my nephew who fired the pistol.
That pup was some dog!” barked the Yellow Dog Tramp,
wagging his tail.</p>


<p>“Well, just the same, I’m glad to be back on my old
log,” said Granddaddy Bullfrog. “There’s always something
going on in the Old Duck Pond. If it isn’t a perch
chasing a minnow, it’s Ducky Waddles. Mrs. Darning
Needle is never idle and the little tadpoles make me laugh.”</p>


<p>After a week, however, every one settled down again.
Little Jack Rabbit had almost forgotten that he’d ever
been to a circus when one day just about noontime, who
should come along but the Big Circus Elephant. Dear
me, how tired he looked! His coat was covered with dust
and there was a dent in the little hat on the top of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
head. I suppose in coming through the Shady Forest the
big animal had brushed against a branch.</p>


<p>“Whew, I’m tired!” he cried, sitting down under the
Big Chestnut Tree near which Chippy Chipmunk had his
home. “It’s a long way from Turnip City.”</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” agreed Little Jack Rabbit, hopping up
beside him. “How long did it take you?”</p>


<p>“Two days and forty-four miles,” answered the tired
Elephant. “But I’m here at last. So let’s forget troubles
and look ahead, as my good mother used to say when I was
a kid in Jungle Land.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>


<p>“Are you hungry?” asked Little Jack Rabbit. “I have
two lollypops and a custard pie in my knapsack.”</p>


<p>“Let’s look at ’em,” answered the Elephant, taking off
his hat to wipe his forehead with a pocket handkerchief
as large as a table cloth.</p>


<p>“Here they are,” said the little bunny.</p>


<p>“Look pretty nice,” grunted the Circus Elephant, carefully
holding the pie with the little finger on the end of
his trunk. “Tastes just as good. Got any more?”</p>


<p>“No, but Mother bakes to-day,” answered the bunny
boy, “perhaps she’ll bake a big one for you.”</p>


<p>When the Elephant had finished the lollypops he felt
better, so he said, and, taking off his hat, he leaned against
the Big Chestnut Tree and fell asleep.</p>


<p>“My goodness! It takes an elephant a long time to
wake up,” thought the little rabbit, when at last his big
circus friend opened his eyes.</p>


<p>“Nothing like a little nap,” yawned the great big animal,
rubbing his ear and stretching his hind legs. After
that he yawned again, turning up his trunk to get a good
long breath of fresh air.</p>


<p>“I dreamed you were handing me a peanut.”</p>


<p>“My, but you snored,” sighed Little Jack Rabbit. “I
couldn’t go to sleep until I pretended you were a big engine
in a lollypop factory.”</p>


<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the Circus Elephant. “That reminds
me. Didn’t you say it was baking day at the Old
Bramble Patch?”</p>


<p>“I did,” replied the bunny boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>


<p>“All right, we’ll make a call on your mother,” said the
Circus Elephant, scrambling to his feet. “How do I
look?” he asked, straightening his bow tie.</p>


<p>“Very nice,” answered Little Jack Rabbit, “except
your trousers. They’re all covered with bits of dry leaves.”</p>


<p>“So they are,” said the Circus Elephant, looking down.
“Have you a whisk broom?”</p>


<p>The little bunny opened his knapsack and, taking out
a small broom, carefully brushed off the big Elephant.</p>


<p>“I can’t reach your hip-pocket,” he said, standing on
tiptoe.</p>


<p>“Here, give me the broom,” said the Circus Elephant,
and, grasping the handle in his trunk, he dusted himself
off as well as Mister Rastus Coon, the kind porter on the
“Cabbage” Pullman Car, brushes a sleepy passenger.</p>


<p>“Now I’ll lift you up on my back,” and the next minute
Little Jack Rabbit found himself riding off on the big
animal.</p>


<p>By and by, after a while, and maybe a mile and a bump
and a smile, they met Old Man Weasel. But Little Jack
Rabbit wasn’t afraid. Oh, dear, no! Why should he be?
He was way up high on the Circus Elephant’s broad
back. Old Man Weasel couldn’t reach up that far, not
even if he stood on tiptoe.</p>


<p>“Get out of my way,” roared the big Elephant.
“You’re blocking up the path.”</p>


<p>“Where are you going?” snarled Old Man Weasel,
stepping aside. My, didn’t he look ugly! Well, I just
guess he did. But that didn’t do him any good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>


<p>“Never you mind,” replied the Circus Elephant.
“You’re no friend of ours.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">from his Shady Forest house.</p>


<p>“Oh, keep quiet, will you?” snapped the Old Weasel.</p>


<p>“Why should he?” asked the big Circus Elephant.
“He speaks the truth. Can’t say that about you!”</p>


<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Little Jack Rabbit. “Won’t Uncle
Lucky smile when I tell him what has happened?”</p>


<p>“I’ve a good mind to bite you,” cried Old Man Weasel,
glaring at Sammy Skunk.</p>


<p>“You’d better not,” replied Sammy Skunk. “You
know what I’ll do to you.”</p>


<p>Of course Old Man Weasel did, and so did all the
Shady Forest Folk. But if they don’t meddle with Sammy
Skunk he treats them very politely. Yes, indeed.</p>


<p>“Well, so long,” sang out the big Circus Elephant.
“We’ve no more time to talk,” and off he went at a rapid
pace, and by and by, after a while, not nearly a mile, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
a bump and a smile, he stopped at the gate in the old Rail
Fence.</p>

<p>“I’ll take down the bars,” he said. “I guess Mrs. Cow
won’t try to get out while we’re walking in.”</p>


<p>“Oh, no,” answered Little Jack Rabbit. “She likes
the Sunny Meadow. Besides, she is way over there,” pointing
toward the Old Duck Pond. “She won’t bother us.”</p>


<p>After the big Circus Elephant had put back the bars
he followed the Old Cow Path through the Sunny Meadow
to the Old Bramble Patch in the far corner of the Old
Rail Fence. Setting the little rabbit down, he wiped his
forehead with a big blue silk handkerchief nearly as large
as a sheet.</p>


<p>“When does your mother take the cake from the
oven?” he asked, with a funny wink, looking at his watch.</p>


<p>“When it’s done,” replied the little rabbit.</p>


<p>“I’ll sit here and wait,” said the big Circus Elephant.
So the little bunny hopped into the Old Bramble Patch
and around to the back door of the little white bungalow.</p>


<p>Dear me, I almost forgot to say that Lady Love, the
little bunny’s pretty mother, was baking angel cake that
particular day.</p>


<p>Pretty soon the little rabbit hopped back to his big
kind friend with a piece of cake almost as big as a soda
cracker.</p>


<p>“Dear, dear,” cried the disappointed circus animal,
“this may be enough for a rabbit but, goodness me! and
dearest you! it isn’t a swallow for me!”</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>


<p>“I’ll go back for another piece,” said the little bunny,
and away he hopped up the little path and around to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
kitchen door. But, oh, dear me! If only he had not
stopped to speak to Timmie Meadowmouse. Just then
down swooped Hungry Hawk. Into an old hollow log
slipped the little mouse, but before the poor little rabbit
could hide this cruel bird robber picked him up in his
claws and flew away toward the Shady Forest.</p>


<p>“Help, help!” shouted Little Jack Rabbit.</p>


<p>Hopping out on the kitchen porch, poor Lady Love
looked up to the sky. But that’s all she could do. She had
no wings to fly after her little son. And, anyway, how
could she, a gentle lady bunny, fight a big cruel hawk!</p>


<p>But the Circus Elephant on hearing the little bunny’s
cries, answered with a loud trumpet and set off at a run
for the Shady Forest. My, you’d be surprised how fast
an elephant can run when he wants to!</p>


<p>Wrinkling his forehead, he pondered what to do. All
of a sudden he remembered the big long lasso in his
pocket. Quickly coiling it cow-boy fashion, he let it go,
Zip! And would you believe it if I didn’t tell you? The
noose fell right over the old hawk’s head and around his
neck just like the muffler my Uncle John used to wear
when I was a boy down on the farm.</p>


<p>“Now I’ll bring you down!” cried the Circus Elephant.
But, oh, dearest me! Quicker than the bills on the first
of the month that crafty old robber hawk gave his head
a wiggle-jiggle and off came the noose.</p>


<p>“Ha, ha!” shouted Hungry Hawk, and away he flew
with poor little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<h2>BUNNY TALE 11<br>
<span class="fs80">THE LITTLE MOUNTAIN GOAT</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, dear, oh, dear, what shall I do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll never get him with my old lasso!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Cried the Circus Elephant with a sigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As he looked at Hungry Hawk on high.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now I hope you haven’t forgotten what just took place.
How Hungry Hawk had picked up poor Little Jack Rabbit.
Of course you haven’t! Nor how the big kind Circus
Elephant had almost caught this bad robber bird with a
long lasso.</p>

<p>But, dear me! I wonder what is happening to Little
Jack Rabbit all this time. Maybe the cruel hawk has eaten
him for dinner or supper or maybe breakfast.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to give up hope,” said the big
Elephant to himself, again setting off after Hungry Hawk,
who now could hardly be made out up in the sky so far
away.</p>

<p>By and by the Elephant came to a mountain. My, but
it was a steep old mountain. Right up and down—almost
straight, you know. “Dear me!” almost sobbed the anxious
circus animal, sitting down to consider the best thing
to do—climb up the mountain or walk around it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Right on the top of this mountain’s crest</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Hungry Hawk has his castle nest,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">all of a sudden, just like that, shouted a voice.</p>

<p>“Who spoke?” asked the Elephant, mighty anxious
to find out quickly if there were a road up this steep, high
mountain.</p>

<p>“Look!” answered the same kind voice, and the next
minute a little white mountain goat stood before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’re a mountain goat,” laughed the
big animal. “I’m so glad I could cry. Maybe you can
climb up and rescue my Little Jack Rabbit.”</p>

<p>“I can’t fight old Hungry Hawk,” answered the little
Mountain Goat. “He’s too strong for me.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, dearest me!” cried the poor distracted
Elephant, “then how can we save my little bunny friend?”</p>

<p>“I can help you climb the mountain,” answered the
little Mountain Goat.</p>

<p>“Me?” enquired the big animal. “How could you
help a great big elephant up this steep, right-up-and-down,
mountain, I should like to know.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be so hard,” answered the little Mountain
Goat. “Give me your lasso.”</p>

<p>Throwing the loop over his horns, the little Mountain
Goat started to climb up the mountain side. First he
jumped to a ledge of rock, then scrambled up sideways,
then sideways the other way, then another jump, and perhaps
two, and then a scramble.</p>

<p>After working his way up almost as far as the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of the long rope, he braced his forefeet against a rock and
called down: “Pull yourself up with your trunk!”</p>

<p>Well, sir, that’s just what that big kind anxious Circus
Elephant did. He took hold of that rope with his trunk
and up he went, hand over hand—I mean trunk over
trunk—just like a fireman, and by and by, pretty soon,
not so very quick, he stood beside the little Mountain
Goat.</p>

<p>“Good for you,” exclaimed that plucky little animal,
as the Elephant took out his big pocket handkerchief to
wipe his forehead. “You came up all right. Now wait
here while I climb up higher.” Up and up went the little
Mountain Goat, now sideways, now straight; now the
other way sideways, then a jump and a scramble, or a
scramble and a jump, or two jumps, or two scrambles
till, by and by, not so pretty soon, but after a while, he
called down; “Come on, pull yourself up!”</p>

<p>Then up went the big Circus Elephant trunk over
trunk—now slipping and sprawling, or sprawling and
slipping till, by and by, after a while, out of breath, with a
dusty smile, he stood by the side of the little Mountain
Goat.</p>

<p>“Good for you! Now wait here till I go up. Don’t
slip, but stand still.” And away went this nimble little
goat up, up, up; now sideways, this way and that; now
up straight; then slanting, right and left, criss-cross, with
a jump and a leap, or a scramble and a scrumble, making
the pebbles fly downward, and sometimes a big rock, till,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
by and by, after a while, up nearly a mile, he called down:</p>

<p>“Come on, pull yourself up!”</p>

<p>Again bracing his front feet, the little mountain goat
held on to the long rope, the loop of which was over his
strong little horns, you know, until the Elephant had
drawn himself up.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed the big animal. “Aren’t we ’most
there?”</p>

<p>“Almost,” answered the little Mountain Goat, and up
he went again. When at last he reached the top the big
Elephant could hardly touch the end of the lasso, and
then only by standing up on his hind legs and stretching
’way up with his trunk. But he just could, all right. So
up he went, trunk over trunk, scrambling and tugging
and panting and puffing, till by and by, after a while, and
it seemed like a mile, he stood by the side of the little goat
on the tip-top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Dearest me, I thought the little Mountain Goat and the
big kind Circus Elephant would never reach the mountain
top, didn’t you? I’m mighty glad, for now I’ll have more
room to tell you what happened as soon as they saw the
nest to which old Hungry Hawk had carried Little Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“There he is,” whispered the Elephant, who had wonderful
far-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked the little goat in another whisper,
only of course it was much softer than the Elephant’s.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” replied the big animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, now I do,” answered the little Mountain
Goat. “That is, I can just see the tips of his ears.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, how can I get over to him without Hungry
Hawk seeing me?” asked the big anxious Elephant.</p>

<p>“Hide behind this rock,” advised the little goat. “I’ll
skip about and maybe Hungry Hawk will go for me. If
he does, I’ll jump behind the rock and you can grab him
with your long trunk.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” laughed the Elephant softly. “You’ve
got quite a head under your horns. Yes, sireebus!”</p>

<p>Then with a gentle shuffle he tip-toed behind the rock
and the little Mountain Goat went skip-toeing, hipperty-hop,
over toward the big nest.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there was a great whirring of wings
and up flew Hungry Hawk, circling just above the little
goat, stretching down his long sharp claws, opening his
great bill and clapping it together with a snap.</p>

<p>“Bleat, bleat!” went the little Mountain Goat, pretending
he was frightened. Then back he turned and skip-toed
over to the big rock.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” thought Hungry Hawk to himself. “I’ll
have a nice tender little goat for dinner. Little Jack Rabbit
is only big enough for supper.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the little goat heard old Hungry Hawk, for he
gave two more little bleats and hid behind the great big
stone.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” again laughed Hungry Hawk. “I’ll dash
down behind that rock and grab that little goat before
he can wink his left eye three times!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Whish, whish! went the big robber bird’s wings, and
swish! swish! went his long tail as he swung around the
corner of the big rock.</p>

<p>Then something happened. Oh, my, what a scuffle
there was for the next few minutes! Goodness me! The
air was full of funny squawky noises and feathers were
flying here and there and everywhere! For no sooner
had Hungry Hawk flown around the big rock to catch
the little Mountain Goat than the Circus Elephant reached
out his long trunk, catching by the neck that wicked bird
before he could turn away.</p>

<p>Goodness me! again. How Hungry Hawk flapped his
wings and wiggled his tail and clawed with his long hooked
toes! But that didn’t do a bit of good. Dear me, no! It
only made matters worse, for the harder he struggled the
more the Elephant swung him around until, goodness
knows, he would have lost every feather if he hadn’t begged
in a squeaky, stifled voice to be allowed to sit down and
talk matters over.</p>

<p>“Talk matters over?” grunted the Elephant, holding
on to the tip of the old hawk’s tail, “what’s the use? I’m
going to take Little Jack Rabbit home with me. As for
you, I’ve a good notion to whack your head against the
rock till you see stars and comets.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t,” begged Hungry Hawk, “I’ve had
enough banging for a year. I’ll give you Little Jack Rabbit
and a cigar coupon if you’ll let me go.”</p>

<p>“Come along with me till I see if the little bunny is
safe and well,” answered the big circus animal, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and the little Mountain Goat walked over to the old
hawk’s nest. There stood poor little Jack Rabbit tied fast
to a ring in the big rock. He was so glad to see his dear
friend the Elephant that he almost cried—maybe he did
shed a tear or three and perhaps four.</p>

<p>Well, sir. Troubles weren’t over, just the same. For
now they all had to climb down the high, steep and straight
mountain side.</p>

<p>“Get on my back, little bunny,” said the kind Circus
Elephant. “I’ll go down backwards the same as I came up
frontwards, only different.”</p>

<p>Then the little Mountain Goat braced his forefeet
against the rock and the big elephant took hold of the
lasso, the loop end of which was over the little goat’s
horns, you know, and down the side of the steep mountain
slid the big animal, first one foot, then two, then
three and finally four, and when he reached the end of
the rope he waited for the little Mountain Goat to come
down, and then they started all over again. The little
Mountain Goat braced his feet against the rock and
the big elephant took hold of the rope and slid and slid
and scrambled and scrambled, or jiggled and rumbled,
down and down, until he came to the end of the long lasso.</p>

<p>“My goodness meebus, that was a high mountain,”
gasped the Circus Elephant, when at last his hind feet
touched the level meadow. “Really, I thought I’d never
get down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” laughed the little Mountain Goat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
shaking his head till the lasso fell off his horns. “I run
up and down sometimes three times a day.”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t ask me to,” replied the Elephant.
“Although I’d do it all over again for Little Jack Rabbit’s
sake.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“Oh, won’t I be glad to get home to mother,” sighed
the little bunny. “I was so frightened up there on the
mountain top with Hungry Hawk. Dear, dear me! Have
I been dreaming?”</p>

<p>“No, not this time,” answered the big circus animal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
“But, cheer up! I’ll take you home in a jiffy,” and saying
good-by to the little Mountain Goat he trotted off at a rapid
rate.</p>

<p>By and by it grew dark. Oh, yes, very dark. You
couldn’t see your hand behind your face. So the Circus
Elephant stopped to think what was best to do. He was
afraid, you see, that he might bump into something or
other or be arrested by the Policeman Dog. One can never
tell on a dark night what may happen.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a tiny light appeared in the distance. Then
it came nearer and nearer, but never growing much larger.
Wasn’t that strange and queer?</p>

<p>And that’s just what it did, for the little firefly swung
her tiny lantern to and fro until the big elephant said all

<p>“I see him!” Which so frightened the old robber that
he turned and fled.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, little firefly. I’ll follow if you don’t go out,”
went on the big brave circus animal.</p>

<p>“Never fear,” answered the little firefly. “I have a tiny
electric bulb in my lantern. You don’t think I use a

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Bend your head or maybe you’ll be brushed off my
back,” warned the Circus Elephant, following the tiny
light. So Little Jack Rabbit lay flat down on the big animal’s
back and away they went through the darkness, in
and out among the forest trees, while Billy Breeze sang a
sleepy song about rocking chairs and tick-tocky clocks
and tired feet and little pink socks.</p>

<p>But Little Jack Rabbit never answered a word.</p>

<p>“He must be asleep,” thought the kind Circus Elephant.
“I won’t wake him up,” and off he trotted to the
Old Bramble Patch. There stood Lady Love and Mr.
Rabbit at the gate, anxiously waiting for the return of their
little bunny son.</p>

<p>“Not on my back?” shouted the big kind circus beast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
stretching around his big trunk to feel behind his great
ears. But the little rabbit wasn’t there.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” cried Lady Love, “he’s lost.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” begged Mr. Rabbit. “We’ll find him,
never fear,” and hopping back into the little bungalow, he
came out in a minute or two with a lantern. At once they
all set out for the Shady Forest. All of a sudden Old
Barney Owl tooted his horn.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” cried Mr. Rabbit; “owls are fond
of little rabbits.”</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s run,” whispered the big Elephant.
“Maybe we can scare the old bird,” and off he trotted at a
rapid rate, the little bunnies hopping along, clipperty clip,
lipperty lip, and the big circus animal bumperty bump,
bumperty bump on his four large feet.</p>

<p>Pretty soon again from a big tall tree sounded the old
owl’s toot! toot! toot! Quick as a wink the Circus Elephant
pushed his trunk up into the branches and the next
minute down came Old Barney Owl. The Elephant, you
see, had grabbed him before he could fly away.</p>

<p>“What have you done with Little Jack Rabbit?” he
asked, shaking the old bird until his teeth—I beg pardon,
I mean his feathers—almost fell out.</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">And frightened nearly half to death.</div>

<p class="no-indent">“I haven’t done anything with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” shouted the two little rabbits.</p>

<p>“Of course you have,” said the elephant, “now confess.”</p>

<p>But Old Barney Owl answered: “No, no, no! I haven’t
even seen Little Jack Rabbit!”</p>

<p>“Well, you come along and help us find him,” said
the Circus Elephant, and off they started again, the two
little bunnies ahead, then the big Elephant and Old Barney
Owl.</p>

<p>By and by whom should they meet but Old Man
Weasel. He tried not to show himself, but before the old
four-footed, tip-toey thief could hide he was made to answer
a lot of questions.</p>

<p>“What have you done with Little Jack Rabbit?” asked
the big Circus Elephant.</p>

<p>“What have you done with our little son?” demanded
Mr. Rabbit and Lady Love.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him,” answered Old Man Weasel.</p>

<p>“Are you telling the truth?” asked the Elephant.</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” answered the old weasel. “I wouldn’t
be hanging around here if I had caught a nice fat little
bunny.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come along with us. That will keep you
out of mischief. When we’ve found Little Jack Rabbit
you can go home to your wife,” answered the big Elephant.</p>

<p>So off again started the party, Old Barney Owl ahead,
next the two little rabbits, then the big Elephant and Old
Man Weasel.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, just like that, there sounded a mournful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
howl. Oh, dear me! but it was a hair-raising, teeth-chattering,
goosey-flesh kind of a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Lady Love, with a shiver.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wicked Wolf,” replied the big Elephant, with a
loud trumpet. At once Mr. Wicked Wolf answered with
a dismal howl. Then the Elephant trumpeted again.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mr. Wicked Wolf has a dismal howl</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And a big red mouth and an angry scowl,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">whispered Old Barney Owl, as a dark shadow crept in and
out among the trees.</p>

<p>“What have you done with Little Jack Rabbit?” demanded
the big Circus Elephant.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him,” answered Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” cried Lady Love.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it?” snarled the old wolf.
“If the big Elephant weren’t around I’d make you keep
quiet.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said the Elephant, reaching out his
trunk to tweak Mr. Wicked Wolf’s ear. “Don’t get gay
around here. You come along and help find the little
rabbit. You’ll be out of mischief while with us and if we
don’t find him pretty soon, I’ll put you and Old Man
Weasel and Old Barney Owl in a big bag and shake you
up and down and all around till your bones rattle!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Then off again started the party, Old Barney Owl in
the lead, Mr. Wicked Wolf and Old Man Weasel next,
then Mr. Rabbit and Lady Love, and last of all, the big
Circus Elephant. Every once in a while he’d swing his
long lasso, cow-boy fashion, around Mr. Wicked Wolf,
or pull up Old Man Weasel with a sharp jerk. And now
and then, so’s not to let Old Barney Owl feel lonesome,
he’d drop the noose around that old night bird’s head and
yank him over backwards. This kept these three bad people
mighty well behaved, let me tell you, while looking for
Little Jack Rabbit—or pretending to look for him.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Danny Fox was seen sneaking behind
a pile of brush.</p>

<p>“Come here, you old chicken thief,” shouted the Elephant,
and without waiting for the old fox to decide
whether he would or not, the big Elephant threw the lasso
over his head, pulling him in as nicely as you please.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you’ve done with Little Jack Rabbit?”
demanded the big circus animal, giving the rope a jerk
to make the old fox answer quickly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him,” replied Danny Fox, with a whine.
“I haven’t seen him for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” shouted the two little rabbits.</p>

<p>“What have you done with Little Jack Rabbit?” once
more demanded the Elephant, although he’d already twice
asked Danny Fox that very same question.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the little bunny,” again whined the old
fox, “indeed, I am telling the truth.”</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“What’s that?” asked Lady Love.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“You never told the truth in your life,” cried the big
Elephant. “You’re an old chicken thief!”</p>

<p>“Please, please, don’t jerk that rope,” begged Danny
Fox. “It hurts my neck.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along with us,” said the big circus animal,
“you may help us find Little Jack Rabbit. At any
rate, we’ll know where you are,” and he made the old fox
join the party.</p>

<p>By and by, after a while, as they marched through the
Shady Forest, looking here and peeking there, up and
down and all around, they heard a little voice say;</p>

<p>“I know where Little Jack Rabbit is.”</p>

<p>“Where?” cried Lady Love.</p>

<p>“Where?” shouted Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Tell us quick,” cried the big Circus Elephant, holding
up his ears to catch the faint whisper.</p>

<p>Then the little voice came again, only a little louder
than before.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Over there by the Bubbling Brook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where it turns and twists in the shady nook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Caught in between two little trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Little Jack Rabbit is held by the knees.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Thank you, little voice,” cried Lady Love, and away
she hopped to the shady nook, followed by Mr. Rabbit
and the rest—only the rest didn’t hop, they all ran, except
Old Barney Owl, who flew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Pretty soon, not so very far, they reached the Bubbling
Brook and, following it along, they hurried on until, all
of a sudden, they heard Little Jack Rabbit calling for
help.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, my baby rabbit,” shouted Lady Love.</p>

<p>Goodness me! how fast Lady Love hopped along until,
quicker than a wink, she came to the two little trees.</p>

<p>“Oh, my little bunny,” she sobbed. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Little Jack Rabbit. “I’m not
quite sure.”</p>

<p>Just then up came the big Circus Elephant. Bending
apart the two trees with his great strong trunk, he shouted:</p>

<p>“Pull him out! pull him out!”</p>

<p>But Little Jack Rabbit didn’t need any help. No, sireemam.
No sooner were the trees pushed apart than out he
hopped all by himself right into Lady Love’s arms. And
I guess that’s the nicest place to be when you’re hurt—right
in mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Now all you old robbers can go home,” said the big
circus animal.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Old Man Weasel.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” cried Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<p>“So long,” whined Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“Tooty fruiti!” cried Old Barney Owl, and the next
minute there was no one left but the three little rabbits
and the big Circus Elephant.</p>

<p>“Come here,” said the big kind animal and carefully
picking up Little Jack Rabbit with his strong trunk, lifted
him up on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Now we’ll go home to the Old Bramble Patch,” and
off he trotted, followed by Mr. Rabbit and Lady Love.</p>

<p>By and by, after a while, and many a mile, they came
to the Rail Fence. Crossing the Sunny Meadow, although
of course it wasn’t sunny at this hour—night time, you
know,—they soon reached the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so happy,” laughed Lady Love, as the big
elephant placed her little rabbit on the ground, “I’m so
happy I don’t know how to thank you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” replied the big kind animal. “Just let me
know the next time you bake an Angel Cake—that’s all,”
and off he trotted to the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>“Good-by, old friend,” called Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you all again,” replied the Elephant. “But
I must hurry, for to-morrow the circus closes in Turnip
City, and I must be there to help take down the big tent.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before all three little bunnies were sound
asleep. Mr. Rabbit and Lady Love were tired out from
their long search and Little Jack Rabbit,—well, he was
tired and sleepy, anyway, as all small bunnies should be.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Wake up, wake up, it’s breakfast time!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The Old Red Rooster is crowing a rime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The doves on the roof are cooing away</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And Bobbie Redvest is singing his lay,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">sang the musical alarm clock.</p>

<p>Out of bed hopped Little Jack Rabbit and parting
his hair down the middle of his back with a little chip,
picked up his knapsack and hurried down to the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>Lady Love’s carrot coffee and lollypop porridge soon
made the little bunny lose his appetite. Wasn’t that too
bad? Well, I don’t know. I’d gladly lose my appetite for
lollypop stew.</p>

<p>“Where’s father?” he asked, wiping his lips on a nice
clean lettuce leaf napkin.</p>

<p>“Down at the Post Office,” answered his pretty mother.
“He said for you to stay near the Old Bramble Patch until
he got back.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the good little bunny. “May I
go now, mother dear?”</p>

<p>“Have you polished the front doorknob and fed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
canary and filled the woodbox?” she asked, with a smile.
I guess she knew the little rabbit had forgotten all about
his daily morning duties.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, I forgot,” cried the little bunny and,
picking up the box of brass polish and a rag, he set to
work on the doorknob. Pretty soon it looked like a golden
ball under the bright beams of Mr. Merry Sun. Perhaps
he thought he’d help the little rabbit. Who knows!</p>

<p>Next the bunny boy fed the pretty canary in her little
gold cage, which hung in the kitchen during the winter,
but when the days grew warm and bright, on the front
porch. After her tiny cup was filled with birdseed the
little bunny hopped out to the woodpile.</p>

<p>“Hello, there,” said the Old Red Rooster, whom Uncle
Lucky had sent over to spade the kitchen garden and plant
the vegetables, “how’s Little Jack Rabbit this morning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” answered the little bunny, picking
up the hoe which the old fowl had left by the flower-bed.
“I’m all right and I’m all glad and I’m fond of my mother
and my dad.”</p>

<p>“Whoa, there, Mr. Rabbit Poet!” cried the Old Red
Rooster. “How do you get that way?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been reading a poetry book,” answered the little
bunny, handing a rose to Lady Love, who at that moment
hopped out to the garden. Pretty soon she went back
in the kitchen. It’s mighty lucky that she did, for just then,
all of a sudden, something happened. And it would have
been quite dreadful if the Old Red Rooster hadn’t given
a timely warning. Yes, sir, if, right then he hadn’t hollered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
“Look out!” there would be little use in my putting it in
now.</p>

<p>The moment the little bunny heard the warning he
hopped through the window, quick as a wink. And it was
mighty lucky that he did, for right there under the trees
stood Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said, with a smile. But it didn’t
look like a smile to Little Jack Rabbit. Oh, dear, no! It
looked like a great big white-toothed grin. That’s what
it did, and I guess the little bunny was right.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a bad morning,” replied Little Jack Rabbit.
“You’ve changed everything.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that,” whined Danny Fox. “What makes
you so unfriendly?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind, you old robber,” shouted the Old
Red Rooster from the top of the woodshed, on which he
had taken refuge.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re around,” snarled Danny Fox. “I thought
you were working for Uncle Lucky Lefthindfoot, the old
gentleman rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got another think,” replied the Old Red
Rooster, “and if you don’t get out of here I’ll send a wireless
message to the Policeman Dog to put you in jail.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will,” sneered the old fox. “How are you
going to send a message, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the Old Red Rooster, with a jump
and a big flap of his wings. And, would you believe it! he
flew from the woodshed right over to the roof of the cowshed
next the Little Red Barn! Then up he jumped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the little window overhead. That’s what he did, the wise
old fowl.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he’s going to do?” thought Danny
Fox, beginning to grow uneasy. “I wonder what he’s up
to?” and again the old fox looked here and there, fearing
some trick was to be sprung upon him.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“I won’t hop out till Danny Fox goes home.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle do!” all of a sudden shouted the Old
Red Rooster.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Lady Love, looking out
of the attic window. But on seeing Danny Fox she almost
fainted.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mother,” cried Little Jack Rabbit. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
safe in the kitchen. I won’t hop out till Danny Fox goes
home.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed that old robber, “maybe I’ll wait
here till the 4th of July.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried the little rabbit’s mother,
anxiously, “please go away, Danny Fox.”</p>

<p>“No, siree!” answered that wicked animal. “I shall
stay right here for a year and a day, and maybe I’ll never
go away.”</p>

<p>Now wasn’t that a dreadful thing to hear? Well, I
guess it was. But just you wait a minute. I think the Old
Red Rooster up in the loft of the Little Red Barn will
do something, and do it mighty quick, let me tell you.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” he shouted, all of a sudden, just like
that, from the tiny window of the Little Red Barn.</p>

<p>“I’m listening,” answered Lady Love from the attic.</p>

<p>“I hear you,” called out Little Jack Rabbit from the
kitchen. But Danny Fox didn’t say a word.</p>

<p>“Something’s going to happen in a minute,” shouted
the Old Red Rooster. “Yes, sireebus, something’s going
to happen!”</p>

<p>“I wonder what?” thought Danny Fox, looking this
way and that way and every other way. But he saw nothing,
except the grass waving in the Sunny Meadow and
the treetops bending in the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he looked up at Lady Love, then at the
Old Red Rooster. What were they doing? And why
was the Old Red Rooster waving his pocket handkerchief?
And why was Lady Love nodding her head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” thought the old fox, “are they crazy?”</p>

<p>Just then, all of a sudden, just like that, quicker than
bills on the first of the month, over the Old Rail Fence
jumped the Policeman Dog, the Yellow Dog Tramp, the
Stagecoach Dog Driver, the Billy Goat Ferryman, the Big
Brown Bear and dear Uncle Lucky, the old gentleman
rabbit.</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o!” whined Danny Fox, looking for a way to
escape. By the woodpile stood the Policeman Dog, a few
feet away the Yellow Dog Tramp, over by the Little Red
Barn the Stagecoach Dog; by the kitchen door the Billy
Goat Ferryman, at the Old Rail Fence the Big Brown
Bear and a few hops away, dear Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o,” again whined Danny Fox. He felt something
was going to happen to him. He knew the Policeman
Dog, the Yellow Dog Tramp, the Stagecoach Dog
Driver, the Billy Goat Ferryman, the Big Brown Bear
and dear Uncle Lucky, the old gentleman bunny, hadn’t
jumped over the Old Rail Fence for fun, but he didn’t
know that the Old Red Rooster had sent for them on the
radio.</p>

<p>Yes, siree, something was, and is, going to happen to
that dreadful fox, for, quick as a wink, they all closed in on
him and before he could say a word or two or three, but
no more, the Policeman Dog snapped a pair of handcuffs
over his front paws.</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang the Policeman Dog, swinging his club up and down
just like the leader of the orchestra in “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll keep him there for even longer,” said
the old gentleman bunny. “He’s always after Little Jack
Rabbit and me. Just the other day he nearly caught up
to the Luckymobile. If he had, he would have bitten the
tires.”</p>

<p>“He’s forever hanging around the ferryslip, waiting
for a chance to grab Grandmother Goose on her way
home,” said the Billy Goat Ferryman. “I never cross the
river in my ferryboat but what I see him sneaking along
the shore.”</p>

<p>“He’s always trying to hold-up my stagecoach and
rob the passengers,” cried the Old Dog Driver, taking his
pipe out of his mouth. “Only last week a little pig passenger
nearly died of fright when he pointed his pistol
at her.”</p>

<p>“He’s a bad lot,” said the Yellow Dog Tramp. “I
often see him stealing chickens from the farmyards.”</p>

<p>“He’d better keep away from my Cozy Cave,” growled
the Big Brown Bear. “If I ever catch him stealing lollypops
I’ll break every bone in his body.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear what they say about you?” asked the
Policeman Dog, giving Danny Fox a good shake.</p>

<p>“Please let me go,” begged the old fox, “I’ve two little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
boys at home who will miss Daddy Fox if he isn’t home
for supper.”</p>

<p>“Let him go,” begged the tender-hearted little bunny,
“Bushytail and Slyboots will miss him so. They think he’s
a lovely father.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” asked the Policeman Dog,
turning to Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw,” cried dear kind Uncle Lucky, “let him
go.”</p>


<p>“I say so, too,” said the Yellow Dog Tramp. “That
song reminds me of one my dear old mother used to sing
before I left the farm to become a hobo doggie.”</p>


<p>“Maybe from now on he’ll behave,” cried the Billy
Goat Ferryman. “I have two little kids. I know how
they’d feel if their daddy didn’t come home.”</p>


<p>“Give the old fox another chance,” said the Old Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Stagecoach Driver. “I remember my two little bow-wows.
We had a nice home in the country.”</p>


<p>“I feel the same as you fellows,” cried the Big Brown
Bear. “My two little cubs waited every night for me to
tell them a bedtime story. They’re now in the circus, but
I always think of them as little fellows. Let the old fox
go for the sake of his two little boys.”</p>


<p>“Do you hear what they all say?” asked the Policeman
Dog.</p>


<p>“Yes,” whined Danny Fox, and away he ran as soon
as the Policeman Dog took off the handcuffs.</p>


<p>“Perhaps he’ll behave for a while,” said the Old Red
Rooster, flying down from the hayloft. “But it’s lucky
for Little Jack Rabbit that I could call you all on the wireless.
Maybe that isn’t a wonderful invention.”</p>


<p>“Come in and have some carrot cake and turnip tea,”
begged Lady Love, hopping out on the kitchen porch.</p>


<p>Pretty soon as they all sat around the table having a
fine feast, the Yellow Tramp Dog stood up on his hind
legs and barked, oh, so softly:</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” exclaimed dear Uncle Lucky with
a sigh, laying down his book, “that is a beautiful poem.”
Pushing his spectacles back on his forehead, he was just
about to sigh again when the telephone rang, One, two,
three! Jingle, jingle, jingle!</p>

<p>“Who’s that, I wonder?” he asked himself, taking
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello! Who’s calling me?</p>

<p>“This is Rabbitville, one, two, three.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grizzly Bear is talking,” answered a deep,
growly voice.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care if he stops,” replied brave Uncle
Lucky, “I don’t want to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“But he wants to talk to you!” answered the deep,
growly voice.</p>

<p>“Dear Little Miss Mousie,” sighed Uncle Lucky, “why
do disagreeable people call me on the ’phone? Why don’t
they call up the Policeman Dog? Please lock the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
door.” And the poor old gentleman rabbit gave a great
big sigh and, hanging up the receiver, hopped quickly
around the house to lock every window, pulling down the
shades and then stuffing up the fireplace with sofa cushions.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“Now I guess nobody’ll get in,” he said, seating himself
by the pianola. All of a sudden it began to play;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, the Grizzly Bear is a dreadful beast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">His claws are sharp and long,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Goodness me!” shouted Uncle Lucky, hopping up.
“It’s bad enough to have a Grizzly Bear call you on the
’phone, but to listen to a Grizzly Bear song on the pianola
is too, too much,” and the dis-tract-ed old gentleman rabbit
hopped upstairs to his bedroom and looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>“Tooty fruiti!” shouted Old Barney Owl, just like
that, so frightening poor Uncle Lucky that he closed the
window with a bang and hopped into bed. But, dear me!
again. No sooner had he pulled the coverlet up to his
chin and tucked his long gray whiskers in, than a dreadful
knocking shook the door and rattled the carpet tacks
in the floor!</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” whispered the old gentleman
rabbit under his breath and under the crazyquilt
over his head as he cuddled down tight in his old wooden
bed.</p>

<p>Again some one knocked on the door so hard that
the doorknob came off and fell in the yard.</p>

<p>“Who can that be? What shall I do? I’m afraid to
open the door and I’m afraid not to. Which is the worst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to do, for whatever I do, it will be that, all right, and all
wrong!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Make believe there’s no one home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Stay in bed and do not roam</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Keep as quiet as a mouse,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">whispered a little voice.</p>

<p>“Who gives me such good advice?” asked the old gentleman
rabbit in a trembly whisper.</p>

<p>“Little Miss Mousie,” replied the tiny voice. “I crept
out of my house and up the stairs to tell you to make believe
you’re not at home.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good little friend,” answered Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“You’re a good big friend,” laughed Little Miss
Mousie, only very low, of course. “You let me stay all
winter in the woodbox by the warm stove. You never
charge me any rent and never let me spend a cent, you
give me lollypops to eat and satin slippers for my feet.”</p>

<p>“Do I really? I forgot all about the slippers, I declare,”
cried the old gentleman rabbit, scratching his left
hind ear with his right hind foot. “Maybe I’m growing
old and full of forgetfulness,” and he sighed twice, and
maybe three times more.</p>

<p>Just then the knocking came again, and this time louder
than the last time, and twice as loud as the first.</p>

<p>“Keep your temper,” whispered the little mouse.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the only thing I’ve got left,” cried poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Uncle Lucky. “I’ve lost my wits—I declare, I don’t know
what to do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do anything,” advised the little mouse, “that’s
what you agreed to do just a minute ago.”</p>

<p>But goodness me! as she finished speaking there arose
a dreadful commotion in the backyard of Uncle Lucky’s
little white house. Dear me, it was tornadeous and hurricaneous.</p>

<p>Please excuse me a moment. There’s so much noise
I can’t even think what might happen if the Policeman
Dog doesn’t arrive pretty soon and swing his club three
or four times.</p>

<p>There it goes! Yes, sir, I thought I’d hear it soon, if
not before. Yes, it’s the Policeman Dog’s whistle.</p>

<p>Out of his nice warm bed jumped Uncle Lucky and
over to the window. The moonlight shone in like an automobile
lamp, almost blinding Little Miss Mousie by
the door. For a moment it made the dear old gentleman
rabbit wink his eyes and blink his nose.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus! What is that big black
shadow under the trees?” he whispered.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden, the whistle sounded again, only
this time way off down the road.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the old gentleman rabbit,
his legs trembling so that his pajamas wrinkled at the
knees. “What is the matter, and what is that dark shadow
under the trees, and why is the Policeman Dog whistling
down the road? Why doesn’t he whistle under my window
and make me feel comfortable?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>But no one answered him. Not even Little Miss
Mousie, for she had hopped down to the kitchen to peek
out under the door. Pretty soon the sound of the whistle
came again, this time a little bit louder. After another
minute or two, it sounded again, only fainter.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Dear, dear me, I’m so sorry for myself,” cried the poor
old gentleman rabbit. “All this mystery is turning my
hair white. What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I’ve caught him! I’ve caught him!” all of a sudden
a voice shouted, and the next minute into the yard ran the
Policeman Dog with Danny Fox by the collar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Here’s the robber who knocked on your front door,”
cried the noble police dog.</p>

<p>“Put him in jail for a century!” shouted Uncle Lucky
from his bedroom window. “I want my great, great, great,
great grandchildren never to be annoyed by this old robber!”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to the Judge about it,” answered the faithful
Policeman Dog, as he drove away with Danny Fox
in the patrol wagon.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so relieved,” sighed the old gentleman rabbit,
“I’ll now go back to bed and sleep till the little green
rooster toots his horn at half past three to-morrow morn,”
and, hopping into his pink pajamas, he pulled the crazy
quilt up to his chin and tucked his whiskers snugly in.</p>

<p>Well, sir, and well, m’am. No sooner was the old gentleman
rabbit sound asleep than the Dream Fairy looked
in at the window.</p>

<p>“I must give Uncle Lucky a pretty dream,” and softly
flying in, she lighted on the foot of the bed. Taking from
her little Vanity Bag a blue rose she waved it to and fro,
back and forth and up and down, till Uncle Lucky began
to dream.</p>

<p>And what a lovely dream! Just wait till I tell it to you,
dear boys and girls, for maybe when he wakes up he’ll
forget all about it, as some people do, even as you and I.</p>

<p>The dear old gentleman rabbit dreamed that he was
a boy again, playing marbles with Uncle John Hare when,
dearest me and dearest you! along came Mrs. Wild Cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Meow, meow, meow!” she said. “Let me play with
you.”</p>

<p>Uncle John Hare looked at Uncle Lucky, and then
they both looked at the Wild Cat. But what was the use
of looking at her, or at each other, or at anything, for that
matter. Goodness me! they were so frightened that their
knees played tick tock, tick tock, and their hair stood up
straight, and if ever there were two scared little rabbits,
it was Uncle John and Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you two bunnies?” asked Mrs.
Wild Cat. “Come, give me a shooter.”</p>

<p>“Here, here’s—one!” gasped Uncle John.</p>

<p>“You—can—have—mine,” faltered Uncle Lucky,
“I’m tired. My thumb’s sore.”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” meowed Mrs. Wild Cat. “Come
on and play!”</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! The two poor little bunnies missed
every time and as Mrs. Wild Cat won every time, pretty
soon she had all the marbles, as well as Uncle Lucky’s
little bag and Uncle John’s little box.</p>

<p>“What else have you?” asked the purring Wild Cat.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered the bunny boy rabbits, “nothing,
only a piece of chocolate cake and a lollypop.”</p>

<p>“Give them to me,” said the purring Wild Cat!</p>

<p>So what could each little bunny boy do but put his hand
in his pocket and slowly draw out, Uncle John, the cake,
and Uncle Lucky, the lollypop.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, meow!” cried Mrs. Wild Cat, “don’t they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
look good. I love chocolate cake and lollypops, ice cream
cones and pink gumdrops.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t take everything we have,” cried Uncle
Lucky, tearfully.</p>

<p>“Give us back our marbles,” begged Uncle John Hare,
with a sob.</p>

<p>“No, I want to take them home to my little kittens,”
answered Mrs. Wild Cat, reaching out her paw for the
lollypop.</p>

<p>“Wait just a minute, the stick has come out,” begged
Uncle Lucky, leaning over to pick up the candy part. All
of a sudden, just like that, he struck out with his strong
hind feet, throwing the loose dirt into Mrs. Wild Cat’s
eyes, and before she could open them the little rabbits had
hopped into a hollow stump.</p>

<p>“Meow, meow! Just wait till I wipe my eyes. I’ll
show you what I’ll do,” Mrs. Wild Cat screamed.</p>

<p>But, wasn’t it lucky? by that time the two little bunnies
had found a tunnel leading away from the hollow stump.
On and on they hopped until by and by, after a while, they
found themselves out on the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>“Whew, I’m glad to be rid of that dreadful cat,” exclaimed
Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Uncle John Hare. “But, dear me!
we’ve lost our marbles!”</p>

<p>Just then who should come along but Sic’em, the
farmer’s dog. Of course in those days, when Uncle Lucky
was a little boy and Uncle John Hare only a week older,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Sic’em was a young dog. Oh, my, yes! And could run so
fast that often his shadow was left a mile behind him!</p>

<p>“Bow, wow, now I’ll catch you two little rabbits,” he
barked, when—wasn’t it a relief? the old gentleman rabbit
woke up with a start to find that he had been dreaming.
But he didn’t see the Dream Fairy as she flew out of the
window. No, siree! Dear Uncle Lucky was hardly wide
awake enough for that!</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” said Uncle Lucky, rubbing his
eyes, “that was a queer dream. The idea of my dreaming
I was a boy again, playing marbles with Uncle John Hare,”
and, with a laugh, the old gentleman bunny jumped out
of bed to look out of the window. It was early morning
and the sky was pink and purple, yellow and red. The
dew was sparkling on the grass and the trees were whispering
to one another.</p>

<p>All of a sudden “Cock-a-doodle-do!” went the Old Red
Rooster over by the barn. And then a robin began to sing
and a little squirrel to scamper over the grass.</p>

<p>“Heigh ho!” exclaimed dear Uncle Lucky, “what a
beautiful world. I must hurry down to my breakfast and
then go for Little Jack Rabbit. He should be vaccinated.
Maybe I’d better call up Dr. Quack, the famous duck
doctor, to find out when he can see us.”</p>

<p>“Who’s laughing at me?” asked the ex-as-per-a-ted—which
means, dear littlest reader, teased nearly to death—old
gentleman bunny, “and who put pepper in my telephone,
I want to know?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! ha! ha!” laughed the voice again, just outside
the sitting room window.</p>

<p>With a hop, skip and a jump across the nice rag carpet
hopped the dear old bunny to peek through the curtain.
There on the porch rail sat Jimmy Jay, the mischievous
bird boy.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! ha, ha!” he went again, throwing his head
first to one side and then to the other, “Ha, ha! ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Get off my porch,” shouted dear Uncle Lucky, “you
bad, mischievous, sneak of a bird boy. Why don’t you
play nice games instead of mean jokes? Get off my porch
or I’ll do something to you,” and Uncle Lucky hopped
back across the hall and opened the front door with a
swing.</p>

<p>Away flew naughty Jimmy Jay like a flash of blue
through the leaves.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! ha, ha!” he laughed, “how peppery we are!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious meebus!” exclaimed the old gentleman
bunny, “that bird boy is a bad one. If he doesn’t mend
his ways I shall report him to the Policeman Dog. What
right has he to come into my house and play such a trick
on me?”</p>

<p>Dear Uncle Lucky was so provoked with Jimmy Jay
that he almost forgot to call up Dr. Quack. But as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
as the mischievous bluebird was out of sight the kind old
gentleman suddenly remembered and, hopping over to
the telephone, shouted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One, two, three, S. O. S.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who is calling? Can’t you guess?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“No, who is it?” answered a voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot. My nephew, Little Jack
Rabbit, should be vaccinated. Can you come over to the
Old Bramble Patch at once?”</p>

<p>“In about fifteen minutes,” replied the famous duck
doctor.</p>

<p>Hanging up the receiver, Uncle Lucky hopped out to
the garage and, cranking the Luckymobile, started off
for the Sunny Meadow.</p>

<p>By and by, after a while, but not quite a mile, he came
to the dear Old Bramble Patch, in the center of which safe
and secure stood the little bungalow in which Little Jack
Rabbit lived with Lady Love, his bunny mother.</p>

<p>“Honk, honk!” went the Luckymobile horn, and the
next minute out hopped Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Has Dr. Quack been here?” asked the old gentleman
bunny, taking out his gold watch and chain.</p>

<p>“He just left,” answered his bunny nephew. “He vaccinated
me. Mother gave me a carrot cent afterwards to
buy a lollypop with ’cause I didn’t make a fuss.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good bunny boy,” said Uncle Lucky, patting
the little rabbit’s ears. “Let’s hop in to see mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Side by side the little rabbit boy and the dear old gentleman
bunny hopped along the path through the thick
brambles until they reached the little bungalow. On the
back porch sat Lady Love, the little rabbit’s mother, shelling
peas.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky, “how
busy we are! And how pretty we look in the blue apron
and string of red beads!” Sitting down on the step, the
old gentleman bunny filled his old corncob pipe with
cabbage leaf tobacco and smoked away to his heart’s content.</p>

<p>By and by the little rabbit grew restless. “Let’s listen
in on the radio,” he suggested, tickling dear Uncle
Lucky’s ear.</p>

<p>“Come along,” answered the obliging old gentleman
rabbit, hopping into the sitting room.</p>

<p>Professor Crow was just announcing to his radio audience
that “This is Station ABC, Old Crow County, Tall
Pine Tree. The first number on our program is David
Cory, the Jack Rabbit Man, who will tell his famous Little
Jack Rabbit stories to the furry and feather-coated
people of the Shady Forest and Sunny Meadow. Tune
in and let us know how the story is going over. Step into
the Hollow Stump Telephone Booth and call us up: ‘One,
three, five, Sakes Alive; Pine Tree Top, Lollypop! Here
is Uncle Dave.’”</p>

<p>“Hello! boys and girls. Guess where I am. Maybe
I’d better tell you before you grow tired thinking of a million
different places. I’m up in Professor Crow’s tall Pine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Tree House. He has asked me to broadcast a Little Jack
Rabbit story. Isn’t that a compliment? Well, I just
guess yes three times and a half. But, dear me! It’s some
job to climb a tall pine house. I’m not as young as I used
to be, but now that I’m up at the top and have brushed off
my trousers and straightened my tie I’ll tell you something
nice and true, for it’s pretty up here under the blue
and sunny sky with Merry Sun winking his big gold eye.</p>

<p>“Goodness me! dear boys and girls, there goes the telephone
bell and Squirrel Nutcracker’s voice is shouting
over the wire: ‘Ask Mr. Cory to put me in the story.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ promised Professor Crow, but before I
could broadcast a word the bell rang again.</p>

<p>“‘Busy Beaver talking,’ came over the wire. ‘Ask
David Cory to say something about me.’</p>

<p>“‘All righto,’ answered the old crow, hanging up.
But jingle, jingle, tinkle, tink went the bell before I could
wink.</p>

<p>“‘This is the Big Brown Bear talking. Ask David
Cory to put me in the story,’ I heard him say, and then
Professor Crow answered, ‘I’ll see what I can do.’</p>

<p>“‘Hurry up and commence,’ said the worried old
black bird, turning to me. Again tinkerly tink, jingerly
jell went that dreadful telephone bell, and Granddaddy
Bullfrog begged to have me mention him over the wire.</p>

<p>“‘All righto, Mr. Bullfrog,’ answered Professor
Crow, but even before he had hung up the receiver,
Chippy Chipmunk was requesting that I say ‘Hello’ to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“‘Goodness me!’ said Professor Crow, ‘if they keep
this up there’ll be no story at all.’</p>

<p>“‘Never mind,’ I answered, ‘I’ll just say hello to
everybody. Next Thursday will be time enough for a
story.’”</p>

<p>All of a sudden the little rabbit shouted, “He just said
hello to me!” and the next minute, “He just said hello to
you!”</p>

<p>“Did he?” asked dear Uncle Lucky. “Well, that is
kind of him,” and as the radio talk was now over the two
bunnies hopped into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“What have you for supper?” asked dear Uncle
Lucky.</p>

<p>“Stewed lollypops!” answered busy Lady Love, placing
a steaming dish upon the table. “Nice fresh lollypops.
The Big Brown Bear was here yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Did he ask for me?” asked Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” replied Lady Love, “I told him that
Uncle Lucky was coming to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll stay here for a while,” laughed the old gentleman
bunny, picking up a big juicy yellow lollypop by the
stick, just the way people eat asparagus. But, oh, dear
me! down ran the juice all over his nice clean napkin.
Wasn’t that a shame?</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed Uncle
Lucky, “that was a very ripe lollypop!”</p>

<p>Just then his small rabbit nephew brought his spoon
down on the table with a whack.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” shouted the old gentleman bunny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
dropping the lollypop stick on his little left hind toe, the
one with the rheumatiz, you know.</p>

<p>“A mosquito tried to sting my ear!” cried the little
bunny boy, carefully lifting the spoon to peep underneath,
“Where did he go?”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">sang a squeaky, buzzy voice.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Lady Love.</p>

<p>“No, but maybe I’m getting a little deaf,” sighed dear

picking out a fresh lollypop.</p>

<p>“There goes Skeeter Peter out of the window,”
shouted his small nephew bunny.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” cried the old gentleman rabbit, hopping
over to the open window. But, oh, dear me! The Old
Red Rooster, who was raking up the leaves on the lawn
wasn’t quick enough, and away flew Skeeter Peter to the
Old Duck Pond where Mrs. Skeeter Peter was waiting
at the door of their tiny house in the long grass.</p>

<p>“Dear me! I’m all out of breath,” sighed dear Uncle
Lucky, sitting down in the rocking chair by the open

<p>“It’s growing cold! I must turn up my coat collar,”
said Little Jack Rabbit, hopping out on the Sunny
Meadow. He had just finished polishing the front doorknob
and maybe his little pink nose was pinker than usual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Maybe Jack Frost had pinched it when the little bunny
boy wasn’t looking.</p>

<p>It certainly was cold out on the Sunny Meadow! Billy
Breeze was romping over the frosty grass, bending the
leafless bushes and trees.</p>

<p>Turkey Tim strutted about the Old Barnyard, spreading
his big tail like a Japanese fan.</p>

But he couldn’t. Neither could he pull up his

Well, I should say so, although I’ve seen lots of little boys
and girls with bare legs in the winter time.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” went Old Sic’em, the farmer’s dog, tugging
at his chain, as Little Jack Rabbit hopped around the
Big Red Barn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Bow, wow, wow!</div>

<p>“Now, that will do,” said Mrs. Cow, quite provoked,
“it’s so long since you were spanked you’ve forgotten you
were once a puppy boy dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Little Jack Rabbit, “now will you
be good, Old Sic’em?” But the old dog crept into his
little wooden house with never an answer.</p>

<p>Just then Little Jack Rabbit spied Old Man Weasel
under the woodpile.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” said the little bunny to himself, “what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened,” chirped little Bobbie Redvest
from the Old Rail Fence. “Old Man Weasel won’t dare
show himself for here comes the Big Kind Farmer.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there he stood with a milk pail on his
arm. So away hopped Little Jack Rabbit to the Old Duck
Pond to see Granddaddy Bullfrog, the nice old gentleman
frog in his white waistcoat and gold rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be going down to the warm mud at the bottom
of the pond,” said the old fellow, with a shiver. “I
can’t stand this snappy weather. Guess I’ll start now,”
and with a dive off his log, he disappeared beneath the
water.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called out the little bunny boy, hopping
home to the warm little bungalow in the Old Bramble
Patch.</p>

<p>The next morning the Sunny Meadow was as white
as Lady Love’s best tablecloth and just as smooth, for
it had snowed all night, the snowflakes falling so softly
that no one had even dreamed of what was happening.</p>

<p>After breakfast Little Jack Rabbit pulled on his nice
warm mittens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t forget your muffler,” warned his careful
mother. Then filling his knapsack with little lettuce flour
cakes, she kissed him good-by.</p>

<p>As he hopped along he began to sing:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That’s a fine song,” cawed Professor Crow from his
Tall Pine Tree house.</p>

<p>“Drop me an ice cream pine cone,” laughed the little
bunny. But the selfish old bird instead threw a snowball,
hitting the little rabbit on the tip of his tail.</p>

<p>Off he hopped, for he wasn’t going to have snowballs
thrown at him. No, sireeman. And pretty soon, not so
very far, he met Brownie Mink creeping along by the
Old Duck Pond.</p>

<p>“I must be very careful these days,” he whispered.
“People wear fur in the winter time and that dreadful
Miller’s boy may set a trap. If it catches me I’ll be a muff
instead of a little mink.”</p>

<p>“They set traps for me, too!” answered the little bunny.
“Besides, I must look out for Danny Fox and Old Man
Weasel. And sometimes, and maybe oftener, for Robber
Hawk. You’re not the only one who has to look out for
himself.”</p>

<p>All of a sudden the little rabbit felt hungry and, opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
his knapsack, handed a lollypop to Brownie Mink.
But what the bunny boy ate will take too long to tell.</p>

<p>“The next time you pass the Old Bramble Patch I’ll
ask Uncle Lucky to take us sledmobiling,” he said, buckling
on his knapsack.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted the little mink, tickled almost to
pieces. He’d never ridden in a sledmobile and neither
have I, and neither have you, but we may some day if we
happen to be around when Uncle Lucky passes by.</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang Sammy Snowbird from a little bush in the Sunny
Meadow, knowing how hungry Danny Fox was now that
the ground was covered with a white carpet. Up at the
Old Barn Yard the chickens huddled inside the warm hen
house and old Danny Fox couldn’t find even a feather
near the Big Red Barn.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep a bright lookout, never fear,” laughed the
bunny boy, and he hopped away into the Shady Forest.
By and by he met a big Snow Man. Wasn’t it strange to
find a Snow Man in the Shady Forest? Well, I guess it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
was, and the little rabbit thought so, too. All of a sudden
two little bears ran out of a cave and shouted: “We did it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine Snow Man,” answered the little bunny and,
taking a lemon lollypop out of his knapsack, he pushed
the stick into the Snow Man’s mouth. It seemed as if he
were smoking a lollypop pipe. But not for long, let me
tell you. No, sireeman and no, siree, Mister! For in a
jiffy those two little bears took it away from the poor
Snow Man, and ate it up, stick and all.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the little rabbit, and, being a generous
little bunny, he took another out of his knapsack.
“Take it home to your little sister.” But the two bears
didn’t have any sister, only an old aunt who didn’t like
candy.</p>

<p>After that the little bunny hopped away. By and by
he saw a great icicle hanging from a rock in the Bubbling
Brook. Now Mr. Merry Sun was doing his best to melt
it, but Mr. North Wind blew so cold that all Mr. Merry
Sun could do was to paint it all sorts of colors, green and
red, yellow and purple. “It looks like a stick of candy,”
thought the little rabbit, breaking it off.</p>

<p>“I’ll fool somebody with it,” and away he hopped,
singing:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>By and by he came to the Shady Forest Pond. Of
course it was all frozen over with a thick coating of ice.
Only the top of Mister Muskrat’s house could be seen, in
the upper bedroom of which, high and dry, Mister Muskrat
himself lay sound asleep.</p>

<p>Sliding out on the ice, the little rabbit knocked on the
roof. But he never saw the frightened Muskrat swim out
in the water. Oh, dear, no. The ice was too thick for
that, although Mister Muskrat could hear the little rabbit
sliding about overhead.</p>

<p>“I must wait until Springtime to find out who called,”
thought Mister Muskrat, swimming over to his other hiding
place among the roots of the Old Chestnut Tree in
which Old Barney Owl had built his little wooden house
in a big hollow limb.</p>

<p>And wasn’t it strange? Mister Muskrat never got the
least bit wet as he swam through the water. You see his
thick fur overcoat is waterproof.</p>

<p>“I have few friends in the wintertime,” sighed Little
Jack Rabbit. “Timmie Chipmunk is fast asleep in his little
warm house. So is Woody Chuck. And Granddaddy
Bullfrog and Teddy Turtle are dreaming away in the soft
warm mud at the bottom of the Old Duck Pond. I’ll be
glad when warm weather comes.”</p>

<p>Just then who should pop out of his little snow tunnel,
for by this time the little rabbit was on the Sunny Meadow,
but Timmie Meadowmouse. He wasn’t afraid of little
bunnies, you know, nor squirrels, nor chipmunks, but always
kept his eyes open for Danny Fox, and Old Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Weasel, who are always skulking around, or for Hungry
Hawk, who is often flying up in the sky.</p>

<p>“I’ve been playing hide and seek all day,” laughed
Timmie Meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“Who with?” inquired Little Jack Rabbit anxiously,
wiggling his little pink nose to catch the first scent of
danger.</p>

<p>“Oh, with Danny Fox,” replied the little meadowmouse.
“But, you see, he didn’t catch me.”</p>

gate, but gave a hop-tee-idy right over it. The next minute

<p>And now I’ve explained in this little poem what happened
while the little rabbit family were sitting peacefully
on the back porch of their little bungalow in the Old
Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed Uncle
Lucky, as he tried to close the kitchen door. “Hungry
Hawk, will you kindly pull your bill away?”</p>

<p>“You can’t hurt my bill,” answered the old hawk,
scratching and pushing the door.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” answered Uncle Lucky. “Let’s see
you get away, you old robber.”</p>

<p>But, dear me! That old bird was very persistent!</p>

<p>“Get the poker!” panted Uncle Lucky, “I can’t hold
out much longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Here it is,” cried the little bunny, handing the poker
to the old gentleman rabbit. Then, in some way or another,
I can’t explain just how, brave Uncle Lucky pressed
it against the door and pulling up the kitchen table, made
it fast to one of the legs.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he laughed, “now, old robber hawk, get
away if you can! Maybe you’ll wish you’d never made
us a call,” and with a hop, skip and a toe-slide over the
floor, the old gentleman bunny peeked out of the kitchen
window.</p>

<p>Goodness gracious, how ruffled and bedraggled was
the old hawk! He could use his legs and his wings all
right, but his beak was caught fast in the door. No matter
how he braced his feet and beat his wings, or flapped
his tail this way and that, he couldn’t get free. No, siree!
He was as fast as a clam at low tide.</p>

<p>“But how are we to get out unless we use the parlor?”
said Lady Love. “Besides, the front door has no spring
on it. It will be mighty inconvenient on wash day with
my hands full of clothes-pins.”</p>

<p>“Shall we let the old bird go?” asked Little Jack Rabbit,
hopping up on the window seat to peep over the red
geranium flowers in the nice green box on the window
sill.</p>

<p>“No, no!” answered Uncle Lucky. “Wait until I call
up the Policeman Dog and ask him what’s best to do.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon the voice of the Policeman Dog came over
the wire, deep and low, kind and soothing:</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, but I’m glad to hear you say that,” answered
the dear old gentleman rabbit. “Dear me, but it’s nice
and comforting to hear your voice. Please come up here
at once.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the Policeman Dog.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you?” shouted the old gentleman bunny.
“I declare, I’m so worried and out of breath, so excited
and scared to death, I forgot to say that Hungry Hawk
tried to catch us all while shelling peas on our little back
porch. I’ve pinched his big long crooked bill between the
kitchen door and the sill, but I don’t know what to do with
him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come right up,” answered the kind police dog
and, hanging up the receiver, he put on his cap, picked
up his big stick and trotted off for the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“You’re a good friend of Uncle Lucky’s,” he said, on
meeting the Yellow Dog Tramp. “Come along with me
while I tell you what has happened to the nice old gentleman
bunny.” While explaining matters, whom should
they meet but the Big Brown Bear, that friendly old dealer
in lollypops and honey balls, the friend of all the forest folk.</p>

<p>“Come along with us,” said the Policeman Dog. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
explain on the way what has happened at the little rabbit’s
bungalow.”</p>

<p>“Nothing serious, I hope,” enquired the Big Brown
Bear, anxiously. “I’m very fond of Little Jack Rabbit.
It was only this morning he bought a lollypop with a carrot
cent.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been serious if brave Uncle
Lucky hadn’t slammed the kitchen door tight shut on
Hungry Hawk’s bill.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed the Yellow Dog Tramp, “won’t
Hungry Hawk be pleased to see us.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, he, he!” laughed the Big Brown Bear, “I’ll
tickle him under the chin.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry faster,” said the kind Policeman Dog, and
climbing over and under the Old Rail Fence they ran up
the little path to the tiny white bungalow.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do, old bird? Break into the
little bungalow?” asked the Policeman Dog.</p>

<p>“You’d better get a jimmy next time,” cried the Yellow
Dog Tramp.</p>

<p>“Or an ax,” laughed the Big Brown Bear.</p>

<p>“He isn’t trying to get in,” shouted Uncle Lucky from
the kitchen window. “He’s caught fast.” You see, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
dear old gentleman rabbit didn’t know that the old robber
hawk was being teased by the Policeman Dog and his two
friends.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with him?” asked the Policeman
Dog.</p>

<p>“Whatever you think best,” answered Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“Please take him away,” sighed Lady Love. “I can’t
go out on the back porch and I don’t want to wear out the
parlor rug.”</p>

<p>“Put him in jail,” shouted Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I’ll please you all,” cried the Policeman Dog, and
taking a pair of handcuffs from his pocket, he snapped
them around Hungry Hawk’s legs. Then padlocking a
chain around the old bird’s neck, he told Uncle Lucky
to open the kitchen door.</p>

<p>It took the old gentleman rabbit two or three and
maybe four minutes to untie the rope around the leg of
the kitchen stove and unfasten the other end which was
twisted around the doorknob. When all this was done,
he pushed open the door.</p>

<p>“Whew! I’m glad to get my bill out!” gasped Hungry
Hawk, shaking himself till three feathers fell on the little
back porch.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a quill pen,—maybe three quill pens,” said
Uncle Lucky, picking up the feathers. “Ha, ha, something
good in everything. I had intended to buy a pen at
the Three-in-One Cent Store. Now I can save a carrot
cent.”</p>

<p>“Come along with us,” said the Policeman Dog, pulling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the old Hawk through the fence. “You’ll go to jail
for a month of Sundays.”</p>

play any tricks on his way to his jail hotel.</p>

<p>“Thank you all for coming up here,” shouted dear
Uncle Lucky. “You’re good friends in time of need.”</p>

<p>By and by the old gentleman bunny invited the little

<p>Everything was going along nicely when, all of a sudden,
just like that, something happened to the Luckymobile
and before the old gentleman bunny could tighten a
loose screw with the monkey wrench a voice shouted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent1">I’m sure you don’t want to be bitten in two.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“No, no, no!” cried poor Uncle Lucky. “But who are
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” answered the voice, and out jumped
Danny Fox. Dear me, but he looked dreadfully sly in
his brown unionalls!</p>

<p>“Please, please don’t bite,” begged poor Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“Throw up your paws!” shouted Danny Fox.</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing for the old gentleman
rabbit to do but obey, so up went his paws, almost knocking
off his old wedding stovepipe hat.</p>

<p>“How much money have you in your pockets?” asked
the old robber fox, hardly noticing Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Ten lettuce leaf dollar bills and 23 carrot cents,” answered
Uncle Lucky, in a trembly voice.</p>

<p>“That’s not much for a rich old rabbit gentleman like
you,” growled Danny Fox. “Haven’t you forgotten your
old leather wallet?”</p>

<p>“No, sireebus!” replied Uncle Lucky, “but I wish you

<p>“Come, come, Danny Fox,” cried Uncle Lucky. “If
you do that you’ll get only ten lettuce leaf dollar bills and
23 carrot cents. I don’t want to be bumped about in an
old flour sack.”</p>

<p>“What will you give me if I don’t put you in my old
flour sack?” asked that wicked robber.</p>

<p>“20 lettuce leaf dollar bills and 46 carrot cents,” replied
poor Uncle Lucky. “You’ll have to trust me till I
go home. I’m a little short of change to-day.”</p>

<p>“All right, but let me go through your pockets,”
growled the old fox, pushing his paw inside the old rabbit’s
coat. Pretty soon he took out a leather wallet.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed that wicked beast, “maybe I’ll find
a Liberty Bond.” But he didn’t. No, siree! He found
only a cigar coupon, two transfers and a picture of Little
Jack Rabbit in pretty colors.</p>

<p>“Fudge and oh, dear!” growled Danny Fox. “Take
back your wallet. Where are the lettuce leaf dollar bills?”</p>

<p>“In my inside vest pocket,” answered the old gentleman
rabbit. But in taking them out Danny Fox tickled
dear Uncle Lucky almost to pieces!</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” went the old fox. “You’re a ticklish
bunny rabbit. Goodness me, but you’re tickle-ish!”</p>

<p>“Tee hee! tee hee!” giggled poor Uncle Lucky, squirming
this way and that way, until all of a sudden off went
his old wedding stovepipe hat!</p>

<p>By this time, however, Danny Fox had the 10 lettuce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
leaf dollar bills in his paw, and was just going to take the
23 carrot cents when just like that, quick as a wink, and
maybe quicker, a rope fell over his head, yanking him
backwards.</p>

<p>“Wow, wow, g-r-r-r-r!” coughed and choked the old
robber, as the rope grew tighter and tighter. Pretty soon
his eyes almost popped out of his head.</p>

<p>“You wicked old beast!” shouted a friendly voice, and
the next minute the Cowboy in Uncle Lucky’s Circus ran
out from behind the trees.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with this old fox?” he asked, picking
up the old stovepipe hat.</p>

<p>“Anything you wish,” replied Uncle Lucky. “Why
not take him to the circus and lock him up in a cage? He
can be one of the wild animals the children like to look
at.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the Cowboy. “Come along,” and
he gave a tug to the rope.</p>

<p>“Drop my money before you say good-by, Mr. Danny
Fox!” cried anxious Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang Lady Love, the little rabbit’s pretty mother, as her
bunny boy hopped into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“How do you remember all your songs?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I just make them up,” replied Lady Love, with a
smile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Happiness is in the heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Singing all the day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Nothing’s dull when one is glad—</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the little bunny boy, “I think you
could write wonderful fairy stories.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe!” answered Lady Love, with a wistful smile,
as she ironed her little son’s blouse, “but I’ve only time to
dream them. Perhaps some day we’ll find time, you and
I, to fill a book with songs of our little white bungalow.”</p>

<p>Just then a knock came at the kitchen door. There
stood the Yellow Dog Tramp, his old straw hat over
one ear and a little tin can in his hand—I beg your pardon,
I mean paw.</p>

<p>“Won’t you fill my old tin cup with coffee till it’s
brimming up?” asked the good old Bow-Wow in poetry.
You see, he had lived in the woods where the birds sing
and the leaves rustle and had turned into a dog poet without
knowing it.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">answered Lady Love.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” answered the Yellow Dog Tramp.
“I’m not particular,” and carefully wiping his feet on the
door-mat, he trotted into the spotless little kitchen.</p>

<p>“My, but you look pretty in your blue apron,” he remarked,
as the lady bunny put on the kettle.</p>

<p>“Mother always looks pretty,” agreed Little Jack Rabbit.
“She just can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“That’s because she’s always doing something for
somebody,” replied the Yellow Dog Tramp. “I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
my mother was just like her, but that was long ago
before I left the farm to become a hobo dog.” I guess the
Yellow Dog Tramp was right. All mothers are pretty to
boys and girls who love them.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be going back to the woods. It’s growing
late,” said the old dog, after finishing three éclairs
and emptying five tea-cups. “Thank you,” and away he
ran.</p>

<p>“Cousin Cottontail has invited us over this evening,”
said Lady Love, as she put away the dishes. “She has a
new radio set. We’ll go over in time to hear the Jack
Rabbit Man tell his stories.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” cried the little bunny, “that will be fine!”
and with a skip and a jump he hopped out on the porch
where the little canary lived in her gold cage.</p>

<p>“Hello! Little Rabbit,” she twittered. “What makes
you so happy?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear what mother just said?” he asked,
twinkling his pretty pink nose.</p>

<p>“No, what did she say?” answered the pretty yellow
bird.</p>

<p>“That we are invited over to Cousin Cottontail’s to
listen to David Cory’s bunny stories.”</p>

<p>Just then out hopped Lady Love and without waiting
to tie her bonnet string, hurried after her bunny boy who
was already half way to the little gate in the brambles.</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me, and oh, dear all of you little boys
and girls! no sooner had these two dear bunnies reached
the Old Rail Fence, about fifteen hops and maybe two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
skips from the Old Bramble Patch, than they heard somebody
or something go “Toot, toot, toot!”</p>

<p>“Look out, mother!” cried the little bunny, and with a
skiptoe sideways they both hopped into a hollow stump.
Wasn’t it lucky that there was a hollow stump close by?
Well, I just guess yes three times.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Who was it?” asked Lady Love, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Old Hooty Tooty Owl, maybe,” answered the little
bunny.</p>

<p>Then they both listened to hear again that disagreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
noise, but all was still in the Shady Forest, so still that one
could hardly hear Billy Breeze among the treetops.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I’m afraid to hop out,” whispered the little
lady bunny rabbit mother.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” answered the brave little bunny, and out he
hopped. But, oh, dear me! I wish he had been more cautious
and not so foolishly brave, although I like brave little
rabbit boys just the same, but bravery and foolhardiness
are two very different things, oh, my yes, indeed.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, just like that, quick as the wind that
blows off your hat, Old Hooty Tooty Owl grabbed up
the little rabbit and pushed him through the window of
his big Tree House.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat you when you’ve grown nice and fat,” tooted
that wicked night bird.</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me go home to mother! It will take
me a long time to grow big and fat. Maybe I’ll grow thin,
instead. Yes, I’ll grow thinner and thinner until by and
by I’ll be as thin as a pin,” sobbed the frightened bunny
boy.</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” answered the old owl, “I’ll feed
you on lollypops and ice cream cones.”</p>

<p>Just then a great pounding and hammering shook the
big tree.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that can be?” thought the bad owl,
peeping out of the window.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope it’s mother with the brave Policeman
Dog,” cried the poor frightened little bunny boy.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” whispered Hooty Tooty Owl, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
scowl. “If you make any noise I’ll twist off your head.”</p>

<p>Dear, oh, dear! that is a dreadful thing to hear from
a big owl when you’re only a little bunny boy rabbit.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the pounding sounded again, only
louder than before.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope it’s mother,” thought the little rabbit, as
he cowered and shivered in the corner of the wicked old
owl’s sitting room. “Oh, I hope mother knows where I
am.”</p>

<p>The next minute there came a tremendous crash—the
Old Tree House shook from top to bottom.</p>

<p>“Rats and mice!” exclaimed the wicked owl. “Somebody
means business. I guess I’ll look out of the attic
window,” and the old feathered robber climbed up to the
garret of his tree house, ’way up near the topmost
branches, and peeped down.</p>

<p>At the foot of the tree stood poor Little Lady Love, the
bunny boy’s mother, and the brave Policeman Dog.</p>

<p>Once again and then five times more this kind Protector
of the Law knocked on the door with his great big
club. Oh, my! how he did knock! What a thundering
hub-a-dub-dub! Crash! smash! went the oak panel, and
in fell the door with a bang!!!</p>

<p>“Where are you, my little bunny boy?” cried Lady
Love.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Little Jack Rabbit?” shouted the
Policeman Dog.</p>

<p>“I’ll be down in a minute,” answered the brave little
bunny boy, “just as soon as I untie the rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, hurry please,” cried Lady Love to the Policeman
Dog, “my little boy is tied fast upstairs.”</p>

<p>Up the rickety stairway three steps at a jump went
the brave dog and the little bunny’s mother. Pretty soon
they came to a dark room, in the farthest corner of which
cowered the poor little rabbit boy bunny prisoner.</p>

<p>“You untie the rope!” shouted the Policeman Dog, “I
want to catch Old Hooty Tooty,” and up the attic stairs
he leaped, only this time he made four steps at a jump.</p>

<p>“My poor little bunny,” cried Lady Love, as she loosened
the last knot and clasped him in her arms.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there sounded a dreadful squawk and
away flew old Hooty Tooty, tipsy topsy, this way and that
way.</p>

<p>“I tickled him with my club,” laughed the Policeman
Dog. “Now I’ll see you safe home, although I guess he
won’t bother little rabbits for a long time.”</p>

<p>Now let’s see what Uncle Lucky is doing this lovely
October weather, when the leaves are red and the pumpkins
yellow as sunflowers. My goodness! what a dreadful
time the old gentleman bunny had to keep on his old
stovepipe hat these windy autumn days. No matter how
tight he tied his blue silk polkadot handkerchief over the
top and under his chin every once in a while Billy Breeze
knocked it off and rolled it along the roadside.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s Autumn again and the leaves are all over
the front lawn. I must telephone the old Red Rooster to
come over and rake them up,” sighed dear Uncle Lucky,
hopping up to the telephone to call up</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">answered funny Uncle Lucky, winking at Little Miss
Mousie.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the Old Red Rooster. “I’ll be
there to-morrow at six.” But whether he or Uncle Lucky
hung up the receiver first I don’t know, for I never thought
to ask the telephone girl.</p>

<p>“I just hate to have my place look disorderly,” sighed
the dear old gentleman rabbit. “I’m glad that old rooster
will be here to-morrow, although it makes me angry when
he leans on his rake for hours at a time to watch the automobiles
go by.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out to the barn to see the pigeons,” suggested
his tiny mouse housekeeper, curious to peep into the little
house which Uncle Lucky had built on the roof of his
old barn.</p>

<p>“I’ll take some corn along,” he said, filling his old wedding
stovepipe hat up to the brim;</p>

  </div>

<p class="no-indent">sang dear Uncle Lucky. By and by he hopped back into
the house for his afternoon nap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning, before Mr. Merry
Sun had taken off his cloudy nightcap, the Old Red
Rooster knocked on the kitchen door.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rat-a-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat!</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">he sang, after rapping for the umpty ’leventh time. Dear
me! Uncle Lucky was a sound sleeper. I guess he only
woke up when his alarm clock tickled him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit,
poking his head out of the window. “Oh, it’s you, is it?”
he exclaimed, spying the old red rooster. “You’ll find
the rake in the barn. Start right in to clean up the lawn.
I’ll be out in a minute or three as soon as Miss Mousie
has made the coffee.”</p>

<p>By and by when the Old Red Rooster had raked up a
pile of leaves almost as high as the spur on his right leg,
he sat down to rest. All of a sudden who should come
limping along on three legs but Danny Fox.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” laughed the Old Red Rooster, although he
never would have so much as smiled had Danny Fox been
walking on four legs, let me tell you. Oh, my no!</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Danny Fox, angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” repeated the Old Red Rooster, with a loud
crow;</p>

<p>“What’s all this noise about?” asked Uncle Lucky,
looking out of the window. But when he saw Danny Fox
he closed it mighty quick, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Dear me, I was dreadfully afraid as Uncle Lucky
closed the window that Danny Fox would catch the Old
Red Rooster. But he didn’t. No, siree and a no, sireeman!
His foot was too sore, so he limped away, saying
with an angry snarl, “You just wait. Some day you’ll
pay for the fun you’ve had with me,” which made the
Old Red Rooster grow so pale with fear that when Uncle
Lucky peeked out for the third time he thought a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
white rooster in his front yard was raking up the fallen
leaves.</p>

<p>No sooner was Danny Fox out of sight than Uncle
Lucky hopped down to breakfast.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Maybe you’d better tell the Old Red Rooster to saw
the wood. We’ll soon need an open fire in the sitting
room,” said dear Uncle Lucky to Little Miss Mousie.</p>

<p>“Goodness me, this is a dull saw!” sighed the lazy
old fowl, looking up at the old gentleman bunny’s pretty
mouse housekeeper.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there came a loud knocking. Laying
aside the morning paper and carefully placing his spectacles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
on the table, the old gentleman bunny slipped his
feet into a pair of old carpet slippers and opened the door.
Who do you suppose was standing on the little porch?
Why, Little Jack Rabbit, of course. He had come all the
way from the Old Bramble Patch to see his dear kind
Uncle Lucky, who had given him a gold watch and chain
you remember some three hundred and umpty-’leven stories
ago in one of the Little Jack Rabbit Books.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” cried the old gentleman bunny and
leading his little nephew into the parlor, he invited him
to sit down in front of the fire which was blazing merrily
on the hearth this cold October day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, the wind will soon be whistling</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">said the old gentleman rabbit. But he didn’t realize he
was talking in poetry. Oh, my no. If he had I guess my
typewriter would have pinned a red rose on the old gentleman’s
coat.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do?” asked Little Jack Rabbit,
being a restless little bunny who could never sit still in the
same place at the same time for even a little while.</p>

<p>“We can take a ride in the Luckymobile,” answered
Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“All right, let’s go,” laughed the little bunny, hopping
out to the garage, while the old gentleman rabbit pulled
on his boots and tied his blue silk polkadot handkerchief
under his chin and over the top of his old wedding stovepipe
hat so that it wouldn’t blow off when Billy Breeze
blew.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon, as they rolled along in the Luckymobile
as fast as a comet, or maybe faster, for that Luckymobile
could go when Uncle Lucky was in it. Oh, yes,
ah, yes; they saw Danny Fox creeping along the Old Rail
Fence.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the little rabbit, “that old robber fox
has stolen a chicken from the good kind farmer.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t help that,” answered Uncle Lucky.
“Foxes must live as well as other people, only it’s too bad
they can’t eat nuts like squirrels, or cabbages like rabbits.”</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden the little rabbit had a bright idea.
Taking out his Policeman’s whistle, he blew on it with all
his might. And, would you believe it! that crafty old fox
thought the Policeman Dog was coming and dropped
the chicken.</p>

<p>“My, you’re a clever little chap,” laughed Uncle
Lucky, when all of a sudden, three little grasshoppers in a
field close by began to sing:</p>

<p>“Hop into my Luckymobile,” invited Uncle Lucky.
“We’ll take you home to Lady Love. You can live in the
kitchen woodbox all winter and when Spring comes you
may hop out and dance on the grass.”</p>

<p>Well, it didn’t take those three shivering grasshoppers
long to jump into the Luckymobile, nor to reach the
dear Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>“Lady Love! Lady Love!” shouted Uncle Lucky,
hopping up the winding path through the bushes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the pretty lady bunny, opening
the kitchen door. How she laughed when she saw them
all, Uncle Lucky, Little Jack Rabbit and the three Little
Grasshoppers. But when the old gentleman rabbit had
explained how shivery cold the grasshoppers were, and
how he had brought them for a visit, the dear little bunny
lady invited them into the kitchen to warm themselves
by the stove. After poking the fire, she put on the kettle

<p class="no-indent">wrote sly Old Danny Fox on the Valentine he sent to the
big fat hen at the Farmyard. She was so pleased the next

she called him over to her nest to show him the nice white
egg she had laid on St. Valentine’s Day. Of course he
didn’t know she thought he had sent the valentine, so off
he went to the Three-in-One Cent Store to buy her one,
all covered with lace and gold hearts.</p>

<p>As he passed Uncle Lucky’s white house on the corner
of Lettuce Avenue and Carrot Street he heard the old gentleman
rabbit calling from the window to the Yellow Dog
Tramp, who took care of the Luckymobile in the winter

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus! How do I know?” answered
excited Uncle Lucky. “You never know who
sends a valentine.”</p>

<p>All of a sudden the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>“Hello, who’s this?” asked the old gentleman rabbit.</p>

<p>“It’s me, Little Jack Rabbit. Did you get your valentine?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the old gentleman rabbit, and the

<p class="no-indent">answered the Yellow Dog Tramp sadly, wiping his eyes as
he trotted into the garage to polish the Luckymobile.</p>

<p>Pretty soon dear Uncle Lucky hopped out of the front
door and down the road to Rabbitville, where he bought
a valentine at the Three-in-One Cent Store for his little
rabbit nephew. Then quickly hopping over to the Old
Bramble Patch, for it was getting late and Mr. Merry
Sun would soon be in bed in the purple west, the dear old
gentleman rabbit tip-toed up to the front door of the little
bunny’s house and dropped the valentine on the mat.
Then, ringing the bell three times and a half, he quickly
hid behind the rain barrel.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Somebody’s sent me a valentine,” shouted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Little Jack Rabbit, looking all around to see who had
left it. But no one was in sight, except Charlie Chickadee
picking dried berries off a bush.</p>

<p>“Did you leave this valentine?” asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>“No,” chuckled Charlie Chickadee, “but I know who
did,” cocking his head on one side and winking his eye
nearest the rain barrel.</p>

<p>“Who did it, then?” asked Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

naughty little bird, and none too soon, to dodge a snow
ball that Uncle Lucky threw at him from behind the rain
barrel. But it didn’t hit him, oh, my no! But it hit Old
Danny Fox who was peeping through the brambles. Yes,
siree, that’s what it did!</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! I’m glad Charlie Chickadee made me
angry,” chuckled dear Uncle Lucky, and the next moment
he laughed so hard that one of the pearl buttons on his
pink waistcoat flew off and hit the end of the old fox’s tail
as he hurried away. Wasn’t that wonderful? Well, I
just guess it was. But perhaps you don’t know that Uncle
Lucky was a good shot and had once pitched on the Rabbitville
baseball team.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to be home in time for lunch,” said the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>

<p>“Because,” answered the little mouse, “I heard Willie
Wind say just now to the Weathercock: ‘I’m going to
bring up a big black rain cloud, so put on your mackintosh
and rubbers.’”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the old gentleman rabbit. “If the
Weathercock puts on a mackintosh I’ll put on my bathing
suit,” and funny old Uncle Lucky hopped into the
sitting room to read the <em>Bunnyville Bugle</em> while Little
Miss Mousie set the table.</p>

<p>“Let me in,” all of a sudden cried a little voice at the
window pane.</p>

<p>When the old gentleman rabbit opened the window
who do you suppose was outside? Why, a little white
pigeon—one of Uncle Lucky’s pigeons, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got something to tell you,” she whispered, perching
herself on the window sill.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the old gentleman rabbit, cocking
up both his long ears and wiggling his nose sideways.</p>

<p>“I have five little pigeons in the barn,” she answered,
and with a flutter of wings she flew back to her little birds.</p>

<p>No sooner had Uncle Lucky closed the window than
some one knocked on the front door.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” whispered Mrs. Swallow from her tiny
nest as Uncle Lucky hopped out on the front porch.</p>

<p>The tiny sparrow’s bright eyes had spied Old Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Weasel under the woodpile, but I guess the dear old gentleman
rabbit didn’t hear her for, without looking about,
he shook hands with the Old Brown Horse.</p>

<p>“How are all the folks?” asked Uncle Lucky kindly.
“Anybody got the measles?”</p>

<p>“Nope, but the automobile has a flat tire,” answered
the friendly old horse.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the old gentleman rabbit. “You
should worry!”</p>

<p>“I must get back before supper,” answered the Old
Brown Horse. “Maybe I’ll be hitched up to the buggy.
I come in very handy when something breaks down.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel sad,” begged dear Uncle Lucky, “your
master is kind and lets you feed on the meadow grass.
You don’t have to pull a heavy cart like many an old
horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“That’s true,” replied the Old Brown Horse, a smile
spreading over his face. “Maybe I’m a little lonely for
the children. They were so bright and happy.”</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! and oh, dear you! just then Old Man
Weasel ran out from under the woodpile.</p>

<p>“Help, help!” shouted the old gentleman bunny, “help,
help, give me a club!”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for you,” answered the Old Brown
Horse. Kicking out his left hind leg, he hit Old Man
Weasel such a whack that the old sneak flew over the white
picket fence like a baseball from the bat of Babe Ruth.</p>

<p>“That’s a home run for him,” laughed the Old Brown
Horse, watching Old Man Weasel spinning over the treetop;
“when he comes down he’ll land in the kitchen and
surprise his wife.”</p>

<p>“Dearest me!” sighed poor frightened Uncle Lucky.
“You did me a good turn.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” answered the Old Brown Horse.
“Glad to get a whack at that old thief. Maybe now he’ll
stay home for a while.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">telephoned Little Jack Rabbit one morning, oh, so early,
as Mr. Merry Sun was climbing the blue sky in his golden
chariot.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll be there in a minute or three,” replied
the kind photographer bird and, picking up his camera,
he started off through the Shady Forest. It was quite a
long walk, for his picture parlor was in Bunnybridge,
you know, just over the River Sippi, but by and by, not
so very far, for his long legs traveled pretty fast over the
ground, he reached the Tall Pine Tree in which Professor
Jim Crow had his home.</p>

<p>“Hello, Photographer Crane,” cawed the black bird
professor, “where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To take Little Jack Rabbit’s picture,” answered
Photographer Crane, setting down his camera and wiping
his beak with a red silk pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, my little crow boy wants his taken.”</p>

<p>“Have no time,” answered the picture bird man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, please take a photograph of my little crow boy,”
begged Professor Jim Crow. “It won’t take you a minute—here
he is now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” answered Photographer Crane, setting
up his camera.</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang Photographer Crane in a sing-song voice from under
the big black cloth, which he had pulled over his
head as Blackie Crow stood very stiff and very still on a
big limb of the Tall Pine Tree. Then with a squeeze of
the little rubber bulb the picture was taken. “How many
do you want?” he asked, folding up the camera.</p>

<p>“Maybe a dozen,” replied Professor Crow. “Send
your bill with them.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget that,” chuckled the Picture Bird as he
hurried along. Pretty soon he came to the Big Brown
Bear’s Cozy Cave.</p>

<p>“Stop! Wait! Hey there!” shouted the Big Brown
Bear, “I want my picture taken.”</p>

<p>“Can’t wait,” answered the nervous crane, “I’m on
my way to the Old Bramble Patch.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take you a minute,” answered the Big Brown
Bear. “Open up your picture box and take my photo.”</p>

<p>“Oh, botheration!” exclaimed Photographer Crane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
again setting up his camera as the Big Brown Bear brushed
his hair and combed his trousers. I beg your pardon, I
mean combed his hair and brushed his trousers. Then,
sitting down on a wooden bench and lighting his pipe, he
waited to be photographed. But, dear me! Photographer
Crane was so dreadfully nervous and his legs so trembly
that the camera wiggled and jiggled and I fear the picture
will look like seven or eight bears dancing in front of the
Cozy Cave.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” sighed the poor nervous photographer
bird as he hurried away, “I’ll never reach the Old Bramble
Patch, and I must not disappoint Little Jack Rabbit.” But
no sooner had he finished speaking than out jumped
Old Man Weasel. I wonder if he wants his photo taken.
Maybe he just feels hungry and will eat poor Photographer
Crane.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“S O S. Oh, please come quick</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">shouted Professor Jim Crow over his radio as that mean
Weasel crept out from behind a tree.</p>

<p>Of course he did it so softly that Photographer Crane
never heard him. He had been hopping along on his
long thin legs, his camera over his back, feeling quite
contented at having taken two pictures.</p>

<p>A good day’s work, and the day only half over. Pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
soon he would be at the Old Bramble Patch to make a
beautiful photograph of Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll take it in colors,” he was thinking. “This
little bunny boy rabbit is such a nice youngster.”</p>

<p>Poor Photographer Crane! He didn’t see Old Man
Weasel only a few feet behind. No, indeed. If he had
he might have dropped his big camera and maybe hurt
the little bird which all good photographers ask us to
watch until he squeezes the little rubber bulb.</p>

<p>But, no, sir! the good-hearted Photographer Crane
never suspected for a moment that he was in danger. My,
but it was mighty lucky that just then Professor Crow
chanced to look down from his Tall Pine Tree House.
Dear me! I can’t bear to think what would have happened
pretty soon, and maybe mighty quick, to Photographer
Crane if the good professor bird had looked the other
way!</p>

<p>“Bless my gold stripes and twenty-five silver buttons!”
exclaimed the brave Policeman Dog on hearing the radio
call. Jumping up from his mahogany desk, in less time
than I can take to tell it, he picked up his big hickory club
and hurried to the Tall Pine Tree.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” chuckled the wicked Weasel to himself
as he crept after poor Photographer Crane, “in just two
minutes or three I’ll bite in two his long skinny left leg,
ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be at the Old Bramble Patch,” thought the
kind camera picture bird, strutting along, first on one leg
and then on the other. “I’ll make a beautiful picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
the pretty yellow canary swinging in her gold cage on the
front porch, the shiny brass knob on the front door, Lady
Love standing on the kitchen porch and Little Jack Rabbit
feeding the pigeons.”</p>

<p>“Gracious me! I wish the Policeman Dog would
hurry,” sighed the anxious but learned old crow bird, peering
down from his Tall Pine Tree House. He could just
see Old Man Weasel’s tail as he crept, oh, so softly
after Mr. Crane.</p>

<p>“I won’t do a thing to that old Weasel,” laughed the
Policeman Dog, as he ran swiftly through the forest.</p>

<p>“My, this camera is heavy,” sighed Photographer
Crane, slipping it off his back. “I guess I’ll rest a minute
or three,” and down he sat on an old log. He didn’t see
Old Man Weasel lean around a tree. Oh, my, no!</p>

<p>But don’t worry, little reader, when “Pop goes the
weasel!” as they used to sing in the country when I was
a boy.</p>

<p>Yes, “Pop” went Old Man Weasel, and the next
minute poor Photographer Crane found himself underneath
that wicked furry animal.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” shouted the long-legged camera man
bird, giving a kick-out with his long left leg.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” snarled Old Man Weasel, trying his
best to bite the poor struggling Crane’s bobbing-about
head.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” shouted more loudly Photographer
Crane. “Help! Help! Please help me, somebody!”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied the Policeman Dog, swinging his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
big hickory stick in the air. Down it came, whacko! on
the wicked Weasel’s little red cap.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ouch!” he whined, letting Photographer
Crane go in a hurry.</p>

<p>The next minute the Policeman Dog slipped a pair
of handcuffs over that old Weasel’s front paws.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear me!” sighed poor Photographer Crane,
struggling to his feet, no easy matter, let me tell you. Like
walking up to the top of the Woolworth Building when
the elevators are on strike! At last, when he had
straightened out his long, thin knobby legs, he turned
to the kind Policeman Dog.</p>

<p>“Whenever you want your picture taken, come to me.
I’ll take you in fourteen different poses for less than
nothing. Why, I’ll tint them in pretty colors and maybe
win a Little Jack Rabbit book for a prize.”</p>

<p>Then off he went to the Old Bramble Patch as the
Policeman Dog trotted away with Old Man Weasel to
the Jail House in Carrot City.</p>

<p>At last Photographer Crane reached the Old Bramble
Patch. There stood Lady Love and Little Jack Rabbit at
the front gate, dressed in their Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes, ready and smiling for a picture.</p>

<p>“Now look pleasant,” said Photographer Crane, setting
up his big camera on its three long slender yellow
legs, though why he said it when both little bunnies were
all smiles puzzles me, but I guess it must have been from
force of habit.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“All over!” he said in a minute. That is, after he had
squeezed a little rubber ball on the end of a rubber tube.
“All over,” and he smiled at the two little bunnies.</p>

<p>“I hope my hair wasn’t all mussed,” sighed the little
rabbit’s pretty mother.</p>

<p>“You’re the prettiest bunny I ever photographed,” said
the picture-taker bird. “Your blue apron will look just
lovely in the photo.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Lady Love, hopping into the
kitchen to look at the lollypop stew.</p>

<p>Then, folding up his camera, Photographer Crane
went home to his picture parlor, to which some day you
boys and girls may go to have your photos taken.</p>

<p>Listen now to my story, dear little boys and girls.
Here we go, my typewriter and I, both of us together, to
spin a tale of a dear little rabbit. By the way, I’ve forgotten
where we left off a while ago. Was it about the Circus
Elephant? Oh, dear, no! This is not the time for the
circus. Was it about Little Jack Rabbit and Chippy Chipmunk?
No? Well, it might have been about the old
gentleman rabbit, for I hear a horn and here comes Uncle
Lucky in his Luckymobile.</p>

<p>In hopped the little rabbit and away they went, honk!
honk! honk!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the Luckymobile could go like the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it always left everything far behind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not even a deer on his swift flying feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the Luckymobile had a chance to compete.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>
<p>All of a sudden, just like that, or the crack of a pistol,
a voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!”</p>

<p>“Now, who do you suppose that is?” asked the old gentleman
rabbit, returning the salute by honking the horn
two times and a half, Honk! Honk! Buzz!</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s you, Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot,” said the
Policeman Dog, with a nice kind of a growl, jumping up
from behind a tree. “I’d much rather arrest Danny Fox.
Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you?” asked the old gentleman rabbit,
with a laugh, handing the policeman dog a ten dollar
lettuce leaf bill. Goodness me! you should have seen that
Policeman Dog smile. He showed all his teeth and his
spiked collar!</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot. I’ll go down to
the Three-in-One Cent Store to buy my wife a new washing
board,” and off he ran to get this lovely present.</p>

<p>“Let’s be a little more careful,” advised Uncle Lucky,
when once more on their way. “I have with me only three
hundred ten dollar lettuce leaf bills and I don’t want to
spend them all before reaching home.</p>

<p>Now while the two little bunnies were speeding home
to Uncle Lucky’s little white house a great com-mo-tion
was going on in the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>For almost two hours Grandmother Magpie had
watched the big stranger tear up the trees. But as soon
as he began to build a house, away she flew to spread the
news.</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you!” cried the old lady Magpie,
as pretty Lady Love opened the kitchen door in the
Old Bramble Patch to see who was knocking.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” she sighed, and maybe her voice
sounded a little bit disappointed for she didn’t like Old
Mother Mischief, not the least little bit.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve some wonderful news,” answered the
old lady Magpie, fluttering up on the window-sill. “What
do you think? There’s a big elephant in the Shady Forest.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Lady Love. “Maybe
it’s Little Jack Rabbit’s friend, the Circus Elephant.”</p>

<p>“That’s just who it is,” agreed Grandmother Magpie,
“for I saw him practicing all kinds of funny tricks. Why,
he stood on his head and waved a little American flag with
his tail. Then he sat on a big blue barrel and blew a
bugle.”</p>

<p>“Gracious me!” laughed Lady Love, “I wish Little
Jack Rabbit were home.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Grandmother Magpie, for she
was a very curious person, let me tell you.</p>

<p>“Over at his Uncle Lucky’s,” answered Lady Love.
“I’m going to call him up on the telephone,” and at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the dear little lady rabbit hopped into the hall and rang
up, “One, two, three, Rabbitville, U. S. A.” In a few
minutes Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot’s voice answered.
“Helloa, who is it?” No sooner had Lady Love told him
the news than he shut off the telephone and called to Little
Jack Rabbit, who was out in the garden eating lettuce
sandwiches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s ride over in the Luckymobile. I haven’t seen
my elephant friend since the circus.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon as they passed the Big Brown Bear’s Cozy
Cave they were surprised to see that big brown furry animal
sitting outside in the sunshine having his picture
taken.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">they heard Photographer Crane say as he squeezed the

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky.
“How often does the Big Brown Bear have his photograph
taken?”</p>

one he took the other day didn’t turn out well.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">sang dear Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“Who’s singing?” all of a sudden, just like that, enquired
a voice through the trees. But the two little rabbits
made no answer, thinking it might be Old Man
Weasel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Uncle Lucky. “Who do you suppose
it is?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the little rabbit, taking his
pop-gun from his knapsack.</p>

<p>Again the same voice began to sing:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I was always content when on pleasure bent,</div>

    <div class="verse indent3">And here in the forest I’ll stop.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It’s my elephant friend,” laughed the little rabbit. “I
know his voice.” Just then they came in sight of a big
log house. At the front door on a three-legged stool sat
the kind Elephant, smoking a big cigar.</p>

<p>Well, sir! You should have seen those two dear little
rabbits hop out of the Luckymobile! Why, Uncle Lucky
hopped out so quickly that his old wedding stovepipe hat
fell off his head and rolled on top of a little ant hill. It
took the poor little ant and her four thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine uncles and cousins and sisters almost
an hour to push it off, but Uncle Lucky was too busy talking
to the Elephant to notice what was going on.</p>

<p>Well, by and by, when there was nothing more to talk
over, except the folks at home and the new baby across the
way, Little Jack Rabbit said;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come out for a ride in the Luckymobile,</div>

    <div class="verse indent3">Do you like it as well as a tent?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I like it better in the winter,” answered the Elephant.
“But I’ve had lots of fun at the circus! Do you remember
one day last summer I shouted, ‘Give me a peanut!’”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image204" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Of course I do,” answered the bunny boy.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s talk of that now. We’ll go Luckymobiling.”</p>

<p>Locking the door of his log hut, he put the key in an
empty bird’s nest and climbed into the Luckymobile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
And as soon as Uncle Lucky had picked up his old wedding
stovepipe hat and put on his goggles, away they went.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, isn’t it fine to be skimming along</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">In the Luckymobile with a laugh and a song</div>

    <div class="verse indent3">As over the roadway we rapidly scoot,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">merrily sang the dear old gentleman rabbit.</p>

<p>“Gee Willie Kins!” exclaimed the Elephant. “Aren’t
we going fast?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” answered Uncle Lucky, smiling as the
Elephant held on to his big ears for fear they’d blow off of
his head.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” he cried, “I can’t get my breath!” After
which, of course, the old gentleman rabbit slowed down,
not wishing to make his elephant friend too cross.</p>

<p>Well, by and by, after a while, they came to a little
hotel. On the big sign-board that creaked above the front
door when the wind blew, was written:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">“Everybody Inn.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious meebus!” giggled the old gentleman
rabbit, “if everybody’s in will there be room for us?” And
he laughed so hard at his own joke that his old wedding
stovepipe hat fell over one ear and he couldn’t hear what
the Elephant said.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out and have an ice cream cone,” suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Little Jack Rabbit. Just like every little boy and girl I
know—crazy over ice cream cones.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed dear Uncle Lucky, hopping out to
tie the Luckymobile to the old hitching post in front of the
inn. Then hopping up on the piazza, they all sat down
at a little round green table and waited for some one to
take their order.</p>

<p>Well, after a minute or maybe three a little white duck
in a pink apron waddled out and asked:</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Ice cream cones for three,” answered Uncle Lucky,
just like that. So back into the hotel waddled the little
white duck, returning presently with a silver tray on which
were three ice cream cones, three lady fingers and three
little paper napkins with roses in the corner. But, oh, dear
me! the Elephant ate so fast that he got a dreadful headache
and had to lie down in the hammock. And, oh, dear
me! again. The next minute the hammock broke down
with a terrible bump and out ran the little white duck to
see what all the noise was about.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” she said. “Did you hurt yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’d feel a lot worse had I hurt any one as badly,” answered
the Elephant, rubbing his left hind leg with his
trunk and wiping his eyes with Uncle Lucky’s blue silk
polkadot handkerchief, which the old gentleman rabbit
had politely handed to him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better take me back to my little house
in the Shady Forest,” sighed the Circus Elephant. So
away they went to his little log hut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>But when he went to look for the front door key in
the empty bird’s nest, it wasn’t there.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” he asked, sitting down and resting
his trunk on the front door-step. “How am I to get
in?”</p>

<p>Just then who should come by but Grandmother Magpie.
Now you know that magpies are very mischievous,
picking up and carrying away all sorts of things. So as
soon as Little Jack Rabbit saw Grandmother Mischief,
he shouted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you have taken the elephant’s key</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You’ll soon be sorry as sorry can be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For I’ll go tell Professor Crow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And then you’ll be more sorry, I know.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For he’ll tell Mr. Owl and Mr. Mouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You’ve stolen the key to the elephant’s house.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, sir! As soon as that mischievous old magpie
heard that she looked in her little black vanity bag.</p>

<p>“Is this it?” she asked, holding up a big brass key.</p>

<p>“Let me try it,” answered the elephant, taking the key
in the little finger on the end of his trunk and fitting it to
the lock. But when he looked around Old Grandmother
Magpie had flown away. Yes, sir, she hadn’t waited a
minute. I guess she didn’t want him to point his little
finger at her and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’re a thief, you’re a thief!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Better hide behind a leaf</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>

    <div class="verse indent1">‘You will have to go to jail</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And wear a handcuff on your tail!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, after that, the two little rabbits said good-by to
the Elephant and turned off for home.</p>

<p>As the Luckymobile spun along Uncle Lucky began
to sing, for he was a very musical old rabbit and had a
lovely tenor voice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed the old gentleman
rabbit. “Did I go to sleep?”</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-do!” laughed the Old Red Rooster,
who was cutting the grass.</p>

<p>Rubbing his eyes, dear Uncle Lucky looked around
for Little Jack Rabbit, but he couldn’t see him anywhere
although he peeped in the croquet box and behind the big
horse-chestnut tree.</p>

<p>You see, if his little rabbit nephew wasn’t near him all
the time the old gentleman bunny felt mighty lonely.</p>

<p>Just then Little Jack Rabbit with two ice cream cones
in his right front paw, hopped up the front walk. You
should have seen Uncle Lucky smile. He smiled so hard
that his old wedding stovepipe hat dropped off his head
and his blue silk polkadot handkerchief bow twisted up
under his left ear.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the nicest thing you could bring this hot
day,” he exclaimed, after which he didn’t say a word until
the ice cream cone was safely tucked under his pink waistcoat.</p>

<p>Pretty soon all the little Cousin Cottontails happened
in. At once dear generous Uncle Lucky opened a big
box of lollypops and they all had a lovely feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>By and by when the lollypops were all gone where
good lollypops go, and the little Cottontails had hopped
home to the Old Brush Heap, all of a sudden there sounded
a loud chirping from the pasture just back of the house.
Off the porch hopped the two bunnies, lipperty lip, clipperty
clip, to see what was the matter. Oh, dear me, it
was a sad sight that met their eyes on reaching the old
apple tree in the green pasture. A young cowbird, hatched
from an egg which her lazy mother had laid in a Yellow
Throat’s nest, was pushing out the little Yellow Throats.
One by one with her beak she lifted them over the edge
of the nest, and as the poor little things were too young
to fly, they fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a shame?” cried kind Uncle Lucky, hopping
back to the tool house for a ladder. Placing it against
the old apple tree, he carried the little Yellow Throats up
to their nest.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the Cowbird?” asked
Little Jack Rabbit. The old gentleman rabbit scratched
his head, not knowing just what to do. You see, he had
such a kind heart that he didn’t want to hurt it, although
it had been so cruel to the little Yellow Throats. I wish
every one had as kind a heart.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea!” all of a sudden, just like that, answered
Uncle Lucky. “I’ll put her in the little empty bird
house,” and away he hopped with the Cowbird under his
right front paw.</p>

<p>“Get the ladder,” he shouted. As soon as Little Jack
Rabbit had placed it against the tall white pole that stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in the middle of the lawn the old gentleman rabbit climbed
up and placed the Cowbird in the birdhouse.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” he said, scrambling down to the
ground, “it will be some job to feed that hungry bird,”
and he took off his wedding stovepipe hat to scratch his
left ear.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Who will feed this little bird</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“We’ll help,” answered Mr. and Mrs. Yellow Throat.
Wasn’t that kind of them? Next, little Mrs. Sparrow
fluttered over from the front porch and said she’d do her
best to keep little Cowbird from starving.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s very kind of you all,” said the old gentleman
rabbit. “I’ll dig some worms right away,” and over
to the tool-house he hopped for his spade.</p>

<p>Now who do you suppose sang this song? Even dear
Uncle Lucky didn’t know. As the voice seemed to come
through the open window of the old gentleman rabbit’s
little white house, in he hopped to find out. And what
do you suppose he discovered? Why, the graphophone
playing away all by itself. Wasn’t that wonderful? Well,
I just guess it was. But then there are lots of wonderful
things now-a-days. Ships that fly through the air and under
the water and little boys and girls who are growing
up to be kind-hearted men and women.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed Little Jack Rabbit, as he hopped
over the Sunny Meadow, “I wonder if Timmie Meadowmouse

<p>Pretty soon the little bunny stopped before a round
grass ball that hung between three strong stalks.</p>

<p>“Timmie Meadowmouse!” he shouted, “come out and
play!” Pretty soon a tiny head peeked out of the grass
house and a little voice answered:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me,” replied Little Jack Rabbit, although
he should have said, “It’s I.” But what do we care?
Teacher isn’t around and school will soon be over and we
will be in clover.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked the little meadowmouse,
jumping down to the ground. “How is Uncle Lucky?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” answered the little bunny. “Have
you heard what a dreadful time we had with Hungry
Hawk?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“No, tell me about it,” replied Timmie Meadowmouse.
“Dear me, how I do hate that wicked bird. He’s always
flying over the Sunny Meadow, looking here and looking
there. But I always try to be here when he’s looking
there,” and Timmie Meadowmouse winked his eye like a
wise little mouse boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we had a dreadful time the other day,” went on
Little Jack Rabbit. “Hungry Hawk almost pushed in
through the kitchen door. If Uncle Lucky hadn’t slammed
it on his hooked beak, making him fast, I don’t believe
the Policeman Dog could have caught him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so,” exclaimed Timmie Meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” answered the little bunny boy. “And
pretty soon after we had tied the door tight so that the old
hawk couldn’t pull away his beak, the Policeman Dog arrived
and arrested him. Now he’s in the jail house in
Rabbitville.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have some peace for a while,” laughed
the timid little meadowmouse. “Oh, I’m so glad!” and
he skipped over the meadow and after him hopped the
little bunny boy. By and by, after a while, but not nearly
a mile, they came to the Old Rail Fence, on the top of which
sat Chippy Chipmunk in his striped fur jacket.</p>

<p>“What makes you two fellows so frisky?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, just because we’re happy,” answered the little
meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” laughed Little Jack Rabbit. “When
you’re happy your feet just skiptoe over the ground. You
almost think you’re flying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” said a voice, all of a sudden, just
like that.</p>

<p>Dear me, I suppose I should have kept you from worrying
by telling you right off whose voice it was that
shouted “Stuff and nonsense!”</p>

<p>It was Grandmother Magpie’s. That’s whose voice it
was. And the old lady blackbird looked most forbidding,
let me tell you. Oh, yes, she did, and no mistake about it.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said the little bunny boy.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re well,” cried Timmie Meadowmouse.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely day,” chimed in Chippy Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“What were you saying about flying?” asked Grandmother
Magpie, with a toss of her head.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I’ve forgotten,” sighed Little Jack Rabbit.
“I was so happy a minute ago and now I’ve forgotten what
made me so.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t answered my question,” went on Grandmother
Magpie, sometimes called Old Mother Mischief
because she is always interfering in other people’s business.</p>

<p>“Mother told me not to answer your questions,” replied
Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“What?” almost screamed Grandmother Magpie.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” went on the little bunny boy rabbit,
brave as a lion,—a little lion, of course,—not a great big
one. “She said you meddled too much with every one’s
affairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she did, did she?” snapped old lady blackbird,
and without another word she flew away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t she mad,” laughed Chippy Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“Serves her right,” cried Timmie Meadowmouse.
“She’s the most disagreeable thing in the whole Shady
Forest.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“Don’t forget Old Man Weasel,” said Little Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Nor Danny Fox,” chirped Bobbie Redvest. “Guess
I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” answered the little bunny boy. “I’m
on my way to Cozy Cave to see the Big Brown Bear,” and
away he hopped, lipperty lip, clipperty clip, up the Shady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Forest Trail, in and out among the trees, through the glen
and up the wooded hillside till he reached Mr. Bear’s
dwelling place.</p>

<p>“My, but I’m tired,” sighed the little bunny boy rabbit,
seating himself on the big wooden bench just outside
the Cozy Cave. “I wonder where the Big Brown Bear
has gone,” and he looked this way and that way, up and
down, back and forth, but no big brown fur overcoat came
into view.</p>

<p>By and by, not so very long, the little rabbit boy
bunny fell asleep. At first he closed only one eye, his left
eye. Then he opened it and shut his right eye. After a
little he closed them both for a minute, but the next time
he forgot to open them.</p>

<p>Dear, dear me! I hope nothing dreadful happens to
Little Jack Rabbit before he wakes up.</p>

<p>Pretty soon as the little rabbit slept on who should
come tiptoeing by but Old Man Weasel. Dear, dear
me! No sooner did he see Little Jack Rabbit than he tip-toed
even more softly around the big tree. Then he peeked
out, first on one side and then on the other. I suppose he
thought the Big Brown Bear might be in his cave wrapping
up Lollypops and Ice Cream Cones.</p>

<p>By and by the old weasel grew bolder. Nobody came
around and the little bunny boy rabbit kept on sleeping,
oh, so peacefully, dreaming about red clover tops and
carrot candies and ’licious lollypops and marshmallow
drops.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” cried the old weasel, softly, just to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
you know, as he sneaked on his tippy toes toward the Cozy
Cave. “Ha, ha! Won’t I have a nice dinner,” he whispered,
smacking his lips,—yes, he smacked them again!</p>

<p>“Wake up!” shouted Bobbie Redvest so loudly that
Little Jack Rabbit woke up with a start. And then right
over the wicked Weasel he hopped just like a frog and
away through the Shady Forest until he bumped right
into the Big Brown Bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, and oh, dear!” he cried. “I’m glad it’s you,
but why didn’t you come sooner?”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the nice kind old bear with a good-natured
grin. “Better late than never.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, oh, yes,” answered the frightened little bunny
boy rabbit. “But if you’d only come two minutes ago I’d
still be dreaming I was eating lemon drops and lollypops,
clover tops and marshmallow drops.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I waited,” replied the Big Brown Bear.
“If you had eaten much more you’d have been, and maybe
you will be, twisted into a double bowknot by a tummy
ache.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not,” laughed the big bear. “Come,
turn around and go home with me. I’ll give you a drink
of Cranberry Tea.”</p>

<p>Then arm in arm, although of course the Big Brown
Bear had to lean way over and way down, they both went
up the Shady Forest Trail till they came to the Cozy Cave.
Of course Old Man Weasel was nowhere to be seen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
although they both looked for him here and there and
everywhere. At last the Big Brown Bear said:</p>

<p>“Maybe you dreamed about him.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no! I can remember all my dreams,” cried
the little bunny boy rabbit. “And sometimes I feel I’m
dreaming all day, I’ve formed such a strange dreamy
habit.”</p>

<p>“Gracious me!” exclaimed the Big Brown Bear.
“You’re a queer little bunny boy. You’re a Peter Pan
Bunny, so you are.”</p>

<p>“Tell me a story, won’t you?” asked Little Jack Rabbit,
hopping up on the bench beside the Big Brown Bear.
“Tell me a story. I love to hear about rabbit giants and
bunny dwarfs.”</p>

<p>“Ho, hum,” sighed the Big Brown Bear, “I’m not
much of a story teller. Let me see. Maybe I can remember
one that my old grandmother told me when I was
a cub. My, but that’s a long time ago. I hope my memory
is as good as my appetite.”</p>

<p>“Please hurry,” begged the little rabbit boy bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, here we go,” laughed the good-natured bear.
“Once upon a time there lived a rabbit giant who had
only one tooth. But it was an immense big tooth. Oh,
my, yes. It was so long that it came down beyond his lip
about two inches. This made him look very fierce, oh,
very fierce indeed, and all the rabbits and bunnies and
hares for miles and miles around were afraid of him.
They hardly dared to pass his big dark bungalow, half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
hidden in a scraggly bramble patch in a stony, barren
field.</p>

<p>“One day as the Ragged Rabbit Giant (for he lived
all by himself without wife or children and so had nobody
to mend his clothes and teach him to be polite)
hopped out of his broken-down, disorderly bungalow,
whom should he meet but a fairy bunny. Such a pretty
fairy lady bunny rabbit.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, my, oh, dear, oh, me, oh, my!’ she exclaimed,
‘why don’t you get a hair cut and a new suit of clothes?
And why don’t you mend your bramble patch bungalow
house?’</p>

<p>“‘What’s the use?’ replied the big rabbit man. ‘I’m
so big and homely and one-toothed that nobody cares
about me. All the bunny boys and rabbit girls are afraid
of me, and I’ve grown so lonesome. No one comes to
see me, only a friendly fly and a little black cricket.’</p>

<p>“‘You seem to have a kind heart,’ said the lady bunny
fairy queen, although I didn’t mention before that she was
a queen. But she is, just the same.</p>

<p>“‘Are you very lonely and unhappy?’ she asked, as the
big bunny giant gave a tre-men-dous sigh.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ he answered, ‘I’m so lonely that it hurts.’</p>

<p>“‘Now you just wait a minute,’ said the bunny fairy
queen. ‘Sit down and fold your paws over your ragged
waistcoat and say after me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Winky pinky lollypops,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Ice cream cones and chocolate drops.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>
<p>“So the big sorrowful Ragged Rabbit Giant sat down
and repeated after her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Winky pinky lollypops,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Ice cream cones and chocolate drops.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Well, no sooner had the bunny giant said these marvelous
words than he changed into a very nice-looking
rabbit man, with a new coat and hat, well fitting trousers
and tan shoes, and where his ugly long tooth had once
been, now appeared a good cabbage leaf cigar.</p>

<p>“‘Now see what I’ve done for you,’ cried the fairy
bunny queen.</p>

<p>“‘I can’t,’ answered the rabbit giant. ‘My little
cracked looking-glass is home in the bungalow.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, never mind,’ replied the fairy queen bunny
lady rabbit, ‘you may wait till you go home. But before
you leave I must tell you why I’ve made you into
such a nice-looking gentleman rabbit bunny.’</p>

<p>“‘Do tell me,’ said the rabbit giant, although now, of
course, he was a giant no more,—just a nice large-sized
bunny rabbit man.</p>

<p>“‘I want you to surprise the friendly fly and the little
black cricket. You’ve been so very kind to them that they
probably think you’re very nice-looking. But just wait
till they see you now.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I’m so glad,’ said the rabbitman, ‘I’ll hop right
home, but on my way I’ll pick some flowers and a lollypop
off the lollypop tree. My little friends will like them,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
and away went the rabbitman, happy to think that he
could please a fly and a cricket.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very nice story,” said Little Jack Rabbit.
“But please keep on till the rabbitman gets home to his
bungalow. I want to hear what the fly and the cricket
say when they see him. They will be so surprised that
he isn’t a ragged giant rabbitman any more.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the Big Brown Bear. “Now, let
me see. I hope my memory doesn’t fail me right here.
It’s behaved very well so far. Oh, yes, now I know what
happened as soon as the rabbitman walked into his big
dark bungalow.</p>

<p>“‘Who’s that?’ cried the little cricket.</p>

<p>“‘What do you want?’ asked the fly.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you know me?’ asked the rabbitman, ‘I’m
the Ragged Rabbit Giant.’</p>

<p>“‘No, you’re not,’ answered the fly.</p>

<p>“‘Of course you’re not,’ shouted the little cricket.</p>

<p>“‘But I am,’ retorted the rabbitman. ‘See, I know
where my looking-glass is. I must find it for I’ve not
seen myself since the fairy rabbit queen changed me into
a nice-looking rabbit.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t believe you,’ shouted the little cricket, who
couldn’t understand how the fairy queen rabbit lady could
make him into such a nice-looking bunnyman.</p>

<p>“‘You get out of here! No one shall touch our master’s
things,’ commanded the little fly, stinging the rabbitman
on his long left ear.</p>

<p>“‘Dear, dear me,’ he said, ‘how am I to convince these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
two that I am really the Ragged Rabbit Giant, only
changed into some one nicer looking.’</p>

<p>“‘We always liked our Ragged Rabbit Giant,’ said
the little cricket. ‘He was good to us. He fed and sheltered
and never drove us away. Oh, yes, he was kind
and good, and we expect him back any minute, so you’d
better get out. He can pick you up with one hand and
throw you a mile.’</p>

<p>“‘Dear, dear me!’ sighed the rabbitman. ‘I’m worse
off than I was before. I’ve lost two dear kind friends.
The only friends I ever had.’</p>

<p>“Just then who should come in but the fairy lady bunny.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter?’ she asked. ‘Why, Mr. Rabbitman,
you seem more lonely than when a Ragged Rabbit
Giant.’</p>

<p>“‘I am,’ he answered sadly. ‘My two little friends,
the only two friends I’ve ever known, don’t rec-og-nize
me. Please turn me back into a ragged rabbit. I’d rather
be ragged and homely than lose these two little friends.’</p>

<p>“‘You shan’t lose them,’ she laughed. ‘Let me explain,’
and turning to the wondering little fly and cricket,
in a few minutes they couldn’t help but believe the lovely
fairy rabbit bunny queen, and they saw again their Ragged
Rabbit Giant master, clean-shaven, well clothed and
handsome. Yes, he was the same, only different.</p>

<p>“In a short time he repaired his big bungalow, weeded
the garden and cut the grass. Soon all the bunny boys
and rabbit girls stopped to see him on their way home
from school. They called him ‘Uncle Raggedy,’ although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
he wasn’t ragged any more. But he didn’t mind,
for his big heart was full of love for all little people.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s all,” said the Big Brown Bear, with a
yawn.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Thank you very much,” cried the little bunny, “I
must be going.” On the way Danny Fox and Mr. Wicked
Wolf spied him. But while they were fighting it out between
them away he hopped back to the dear Old Bramble
Patch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUNNY_TALE_24">BUNNY TALE 24<br>
<span class="fs80">GRANDDADDY BULLFROG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Granddaddy Bullfrog was a wise sort of a person.
He rarely spoke, but when he did he always said something
worth while.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” shouted Little Jack Rabbit one sunshiny
forenoon, stopping at the Old Duck Pond where
the Old Gentleman Frog was sitting on a log.</p>

<p>“It’s a good morning if you have helped your mother
with her work,” answered Granddaddy Bullfrog.</p>

<p>“I have,” replied the little bunny boy. “I’ve polished
the front doorknob, fed the canary and filled the woodbox
with kindling.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good little bunny boy,” answered the wise
old frog. “When I was a tadpole I worked hard for my
mother, but it never hurt me. No, siree!” and Granddaddy
Bullfrog smoothed down the wrinkle in his white
waistcoat and wiped his spectacles on a clean piece of
meadow grass.</p>

<p>“You said, ‘When you were a tadpole.’ Does that
mean when you were a boy?” asked Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s what it means,” replied the old gentleman
frog, snapping up a fly that ventured too near the
big log.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Oriole from her nest in the Weeping
Willow Tree began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Up here in my stocking-like nest we swing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">My little birdies and I.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We are content ’neath our willow tent</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">To sing as the day goes by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“When will your little birds learn to fly?” asked the
curious bunny boy rabbit.</p>

<p>“As soon as their wings are strong and well feathered,”
answered the pretty lady bird mother. “It won’t
be long.”</p>

<p>“Ker dunk, ker dunk!” croaked Granddaddy Bullfrog.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like cabbage leaf cigars?” asked the little
bunny boy, as the old gentleman frog wiped a tear from
his left eye.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” he answered. “But I can’t catch flies
and smoke at the same time!”</p>

<p>Just then along came a buzzy bluebottle fly. Out
dropped the cabbage leaf cigar as Granddaddy Bullfrog
opened his mouth. Sputter, sputter! and the big cigar
floated away, frightening Taddy Tadpole almost to death.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever start smoking,” advised the old gentleman
frog. “Cabbage is good to eat, but it makes poor
cigars.”</p>

<p>“I never will,” answered the little bunny boy.
“Mother doesn’t like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Pretty soon Granddaddy Bullfrog closed his eyes.
Thinking he was asleep, the bunny boy hopped away up
the Old Cow Path, over the hill, till by and by, after a
while, and a song and a smile, he came to the Big Red
Barn, on the top of which stood the Weathercock on his
gilded toe.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the bunny boy, “I must borrow
an umbrella. However, just then he spied a large toadstool.</p>

<p>“That will do!” he laughed, and holding it over his
head, he quickly hopped away.</p>

<p>“I’m going for a swim,” quacked Ducky Waddles,
and off he went through the gate and across the Sunny
Meadow to the Old Duck Pond, where all day long the
blue Darning Needles skimmed over the water.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” quacked the wabbly little duck.</p>

<p>“The same to you,” answered the old gentleman frog,
“fine day if it doesn’t rain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it does,” answered Ducky Waddles,
paddling off from the shore like a green-feathered ferryboat.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Well, well, well,” cried Granddaddy Bullfrog.
“What have we here? A duck poet?”</p>

<p>But Ducky Waddles was out of hearing by this time.
Well, I should say yes, twice over. He was standing on
his head, trying to catch a little fish that shimmered in
the water.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Mrs. Oriole from her
stocking-like nest in the Weeping Willow Tree.</p>

<p>“I just remarked that we had a poet in Ducky Waddles,”
answered Granddaddy Bullfrog. “Did you hear
him answer me in rime?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” replied Mrs. Oriole. “I was busy with
the children. But I heard you say something about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
duck poet. I should say he was an acrobat. Look at
him now,” and Mrs. Oriole pointed to Ducky Waddles
still standing on his head in the water.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Granddaddy Bullfrog. “He’s
fishing, that’s what he’s doing.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon along came Teddy Turtle with his strong
shell house on his back. He didn’t have to worry about
hotels in the summer. No, indeed! He carried his little
bungalow on his back and stopped wherever he wanted
to. Yes, sir. He could go to Newport or Narragansett
Pier for the summer if he wished, I dare say. But I’m not
quite sure.</p>

<p>“Is that Ducky Waddles out there in the pond?” asked
the little turtle.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s who it is,” replied Granddaddy Bullfrog,
“he’s catching fish and I’m catching flies and the sun is
shining up in the skies.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” thought Teddy Turtle. “Granddaddy
Bullfrog is talking poetry. I’d better be going,” and off
he went.</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! Just as the little turtle crawled
away from the Old Duck Pond all of a sudden, just like
that, a shadow came across the sun. Into the pond went
Granddaddy Bullfrog and into his shell house went Teddy
Turtle’s head and tail.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” cried Hungry Hawk, for it was his
shadow that had fallen on the meadow as he passed between
the sun and the slow crawling turtle. “I thought
I had you this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Did you?” asked Teddy Turtle from the inside of his
shell. “Maybe you would if I hadn’t pulled in my head
and tail.”</p>

<p>“Now what am I going to do for dinner?” asked the
old robber bird.</p>

<p>“I don’t know and I don’t care,” replied Teddy Turtle.
“Just fly away, will you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Hungry Hawk.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked Teddy Turtle after a few
moments, carefully pushing out his head, but only a little
way, you know. But no one answered. So the little turtle
pushed out his head a little more, trying his best to look
three or four ways all at once.</p>

<p>“Look out! Look out!” whispered Billy Breeze.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing,” answered the little turtle.
“Only I’m afraid to look out too far.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, be careful,” whispered Billy Breeze.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Teddy Turtle. “I can’t
hear very well inside my shell house.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, be careful!” whispered Billy Breeze.</p>

<p>But, dear me! Teddy Turtle was getting curious.
Yes, sir, he was getting so curious that he just couldn’t
keep his head indoors any longer.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Billy Breeze. But, oh, dear me!
It was too late. Robber Hawk had already grabbed the
little turtle’s head.</p>

<p>“Let me go! Let me go!” begged the frightened little
turtle.</p>

But, goodness me! He soon found out what a heavy thing
a turtle is. Pretty soon the old hawk’s wings grew tired.
Oh, very weary, indeed.</p>

<p>“I must rest,” he said to himself, turning toward an
old dead tree near the edge of the Shady Forest.</p>

<p>“Let me go! Let me go!” again and again begged
Teddy Turtle.</p>

<p>“Be still, will you?” answered the old robber bird, doing
his best to keep his balance on the limb of the dead
tree and at the same time hold on to the wiggly jiggly
little turtle.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” answered Teddy Turtle, with another
wiggle and a jiggle, and maybe a wiggle-jiggle-jiggle
after that.</p>

<p>But, try as he might, he couldn’t wiggle loose from
the bad hawk’s claws. Pretty soon the old bird flew off
again with the little turtle.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wiggle, jiggle all you can.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Wiggle like a wrestling man.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">shouted Billy Breeze.</p>

<p>“Stop talking to Teddy Turtle,” screamed Hungry
Hawk, by this time out of breath and nearly ready to drop.</p>

<p>“Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle!” again shouted Billy
Breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>Then Teddy Turtle wiggled and jiggled and jiggled
and wiggled until all of a sudden, just like that, Hungry
Hawk couldn’t hold him a minute longer. Down dropped
the little turtle right into the Bubbling Brook and off went
Hungry Hawk to rest his weary wings in a near-by tree.</p>

<p>“Look out for him when he’s rested,” whispered Billy
Breeze.</p>

<p>“I’ll swim away,” answered Teddy Turtle, and down
the stream he went as fast as he could go. Pretty soon he
came to a nice deep place under a shelving bank. Here
he hid for a long time. And maybe he would be hiding
there yet if Billy Breeze hadn’t been on the lookout.</p>

<p>“The old hawk has flown away,” he whispered, dancing
over the tall water grass that stood barefoot in the cool
water.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the little turtle, anxiously. “I
don’t want to be caught again. Dear me, but my neck is
scratched. Hungry Hawk has sharp claws.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s gone. He’s flown away. Maybe he’s
home by this time,” answered Billy Breeze.</p>

<p>Teddy Turtle waited a few minutes longer, then swam
boldly down the Bubbling Brook towards the Shady
Forest. “Dear me, it’s a long way to Busy Beaver’s home,
but I’ll be safe there, I know.”</p>

<p>“That’s a beautiful poem,” thought Uncle Lucky,
looking up from his morning paper as Reddy Comb, the
rooster newsboy, strutted away.</p>

<p>Just then Little Jack Rabbit came hopping up the
path.</p>

<p>“Let’s make a call on somebody,” suddenly suggested
the old gentleman bunny.</p>

<p>“All right, but not on Grandmother Magpie,” answered
the bunny boy, climbing into the Luckymobile.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied kind Uncle Lucky. “She’s too
meddlesome.”</p>

<p>Quickly turning down a road leading away from the
Shady Forest, in which the old lady magpie had her home,
they soon came to a little log hut in a cornfield.</p>

<p>“I wonder who lives there,” exclaimed the old gentleman
rabbit. “I never saw that little house before,” and
stopping the Luckymobile, he hopped over to the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
log hut to knock on the door. The next moment it was
opened by their friend, the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he cried. “I’m glad to see you.
Come in and sit down.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“I’ll be back in a minute,” shouted Uncle Lucky to
his bunny nephew.</p>

<p>But imagine the old gentleman rabbit’s surprise to find
Turkey Tim in the little log hut.</p>

<p>“What, you here!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky. All of a
sudden poor Turkey Tim began to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“He’s afraid of Thanksgiving,” explained the Scarecrow.
“But I’ll hide him here till Spring.”</p>

<p>“Dear, oh, dear!” gasped astonished Uncle Lucky.
“I’m glad you’re so kind. Dearest me, I’m flustered! I
didn’t know you lived here.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do now that summer time is over,” answered
the Scarecrow. “You don’t think I’d stay out in
the cornfield all winter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what would be the use?” agreed Uncle Lucky.
“Besides, you might catch your death of cold.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” answered the Scarecrow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My clothes are very old and worn</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And one of the pockets badly torn.</div>

    <div class="verse indent3">And give me a terrible frog in my throat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Come with us,” invited Uncle Lucky. “It’s a beautiful
day for a ride. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>With a happy smile, the Scarecrow took down his old
hat from the wooden peg behind the door and, pinning
his coat around him, for the buttons were all gone, you
know, told Turkey Tim he’d be back shortly.</p>

<p>As soon as dear Uncle Lucky had honked the horn
three times and a half, away they went down to the Three-in-One
Cent Store to buy a toothbrush. You see, the
Scarecrow had forgotten all about it when moving into
the little log hut in the middle of the cornfield.</p>

<p>“And now where shall we go?” asked Uncle Lucky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
as the Scarecrow once more seated himself in the Luckymobile,
for it hadn’t taken him nearly as long to buy the
toothbrush as it had his last Liberty Bond!</p>

<p>“Let’s call on the Tailor Bird. We ought to get
measured for our winter overcoats.” So they turned
down a road leading to Birdville, a pretty little town not
far away. Well, by and by, after a mile and a laugh and
a smile, they came to the Tailor Bird’s Shop on the corner
of Twitter Avenue and Chirp Street. There on a
little bench in front of the store, sat the Tailor Bird himself,
although it was the first of November.</p>

<p>No sooner did this in-dus-tri-ous bird see the two little
rabbits in the Luckymobile than he began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Stitch, stitch, stitch away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I’m busy sewing all the day</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I hardly have a chance to sing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">My needle uses up the string</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">So fast I haven’t time to play.</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Why, I can’t even stop to say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">‘Good Morning, it’s a pleasant day!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the Tailor Bird made his needle go so fast that
Uncle Lucky couldn’t tell on whose overcoat the old bird
was sewing buttons.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll get along with my old one,” said the old
gentleman rabbit, and, waving good-by to the Tailor Bird,
he soon reached Cottontail Square, where they found a
big crowd gathered around the statues of Uncle Sam and
Aunt Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“What’s all this about?” asked the old gentleman,
curiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll enquire,” answered the Scarecrow, standing up
on the rear seat. Just then a bunny man, carrying in his
arms a little boy rabbit, pushed his way out.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! is he hurt?” anxiously asked dear, kind
Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“No, no!” shouted back the bunny man. “It’s Tinkle
Timmy, the fairy bunny child. He’s only frightened.
I’m taking him back to the Fairy Glen.”</p>

<p>“You have a kind heart,” said Uncle Lucky. “Come
around to the bank to-morrow. Maybe we need a porter.”</p>

<p>Then away drove the old gentleman bunny. Pretty
soon they came to the Farmyard.</p>

<p>“Bow, wow!” barked Old Sic’em, the farmer’s dog.</p>

<p>“Come here, I want to whisper in your ear,” said the
old gentleman rabbit, leaning out of the Luckymobile.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look out for Danny Fox to-night,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">So catch him by his curlicue,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">he whispered to the old watch-dog as he stood on his tip
toes.</p>

<p>“Where is his curlicue?” asked Old Sic’em.</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean his bushy tail,” laughed Uncle Lucky,
“but as tail doesn’t always rime in poetry I said “cue”
instead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” answered Old Sic’em. “I’ll be on the
lookout,” and with a wag of his curlicue,—beg pardon,
I mean his long thin tail, he said good-by. Then away
went the Luckymobile so fast that it nearly ran over a
man who mended old tin pails, wash boilers and maybe
other things.</p>

<p>“Helloa, there!” shouted Uncle Lucky, “can you mend
a hole in my woolen sock?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you poke fun at me,” answered the tin man
with a dreadful angry look, “rabbits don’t wear stockings!”
But when Uncle Lucky handed him a ten carrot
gold piece the tin man began to smile.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the old gentleman bunny spied a great
tremendous pumpkin in a cornfield.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” exclaimed Uncle Lucky to the Luckymobile,
which stopped just like that, only maybe a little
quicker. “Let’s take the pumpkin home with us.” But,
dear me! how disappointed he was after hopping over the
fence. The pumpkin was so heavy that dear Uncle Lucky
couldn’t lift it to save his whiskers. Neither could Little
Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Old Scarecrow, who had been
sound asleep all this time, woke up.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” he said and, jumping out, lifted
the pumpkin up in his arms into the Luckymobile without
even scratching the shell.</p>

<p>As soon as the Scarecrow was seated, away they went
and pretty soon, not so very far, nor so very long, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
came to a cross road. Right there stood a big sign post
on which was written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To Rabbitville, 1 mile</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Gracious me!” cried Little Jack Rabbit. “I don’t
know where I’d rather go.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Professor Crow, just then flying by
with his little Wisdom Book in his left claw.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now listen to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For a minute or three,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and turning to page one, oh, oh! he read aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Never hurry, never worry,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">So the tortoise beat the hare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Where did you get your wonderful little Wisdom
Book?” asked Uncle Lucky, taking off his goggles and
scratching his left ear with his right hind foot.</p>

<p>“That’s my secret,” answered the old black bird, with
a smile, winking his little black eyes and curling his
feathers with his beak.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a Wisdom Book,” went on the old gentleman
rabbit. “It’s full of good things.”</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image240" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“I’ll tell you,” said Professor Crow.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“I’ll tell you something since you’re so fond of my
little book. I’ve written in it all the good things I’ve
heard. You see, when I first bought it at the Three-in-One
Cent Store, it was only full of white pages, but now
it’s full of wise things,” answered the old crow, glancing
up over his spectacles. All of a sudden he took out his
fountain pen and shouted: “Listen! I’ve just thought of
something:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">“Frogs from little Tadpoles grow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>
<p>Then with a bang he closed his book and, snapping his
bill, flapped his wings and flew away, but where he went
I cannot say.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we ask him which road to take?” sighed
the Scarecrow, looking up at the sign-post. “I don’t know
anybody in Lettuce Hill and what’s the use of going to
Rabbitville when you two little rabbits are here and not
there. I’m sure I don’t want to go to Turnip City. My
wife’s mother now lives there and for me she doesn’t care.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed kind Uncle Lucky, “let’s go
home—the best place of all,” and turning the Luckymobile
to the right, after a while, and more than a mile, and
maybe a smile, they met a funny Little Donkey with two
baskets over his back, one on each side.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Rooster sings his cock-ado,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The Old Cow sometimes gives a moo,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">When he puts back his ears and gives a bray?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What does he say?” asked Uncle Lucky, making the
Luckymobile trot by the side of the Little Donkey as
nicely as you please.</p>

<p>“He says: ‘Look out for my heels!’” laughed the little
long-eared animal, throwing out his hind legs to show
how high he could kick. But, oh, dear me! He should
have known better, for out rolled the carrots all over the
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Out hopped dear Uncle Lucky, kind Little Jack
Rabbit and the nice old Scarecrow to help him pick them
up. As soon as the baskets were filled and fastened on
straight, for they were all wiggly waggly, you know, the
Little Donkey said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Next time I’ll think before I kick</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And look before I leap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And lock the stable door before</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I lay me down to sleep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Come in with us,” said kind Uncle Lucky. “We’re
going your way.”</p>

<p>Carefully climbing in, the Little Donkey set down the
baskets of carrots. Pretty soon on reaching a little green
barn he shouted:</p>

<p>“I live right here. Come, stay awhile. Although I
live in a barn I have nice things. Besides, I own three
Liberty Bonds and a cigar coupon. Oh, yes, I’m a patriotic
donkey. My two brothers went to France with
the U. S. Army,” and, pointing to a small iron safe in one
corner, he added in a whisper, “That’s where I keep my
money.”</p>

<p>“You can’t beat me,” said the Scarecrow. And would
you believe it? He put his hand in his inside coat pocket
and drew out three Liberty Bonds! Yes, sir, he did!
“And I’m not going to sell them, either,” he added, pinning
his overcoat carefully over his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“If you’ll wait a minute while I put the carrots in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
pantry,” said the Little Donkey, “I’ll come back and make
you some nice candy.”</p>

<p>At once the little rabbits and the Scarecrow sat down
and waited until the Little Donkey returned with some
maple sugar, a lemon lollypop and a chocolate caramel.
Filling a saucepan with water, he soon had a wonderful
candy boiling on the stove. After it was all done he put
it down the well to cool, and when it was hard and nice
he gave a piece to the little rabbits and another piece to
the Scarecrow, who said it was much finer than any he
had ever tasted from the Three-in-One Cent Store.</p>

<p>By and by Uncle Lucky, looking at his watch, said
it was time to leave and, thanking the Little Donkey for
a pleasant time, the old gentleman rabbit hopped into the
Luckymobile.</p>

<p>“You can drop me off at the cornfield,” said the
Scarecrow. “Turkey Tim must be lonesome by this
time.”</p>

<p>And shortly after the two little rabbits were safe at
home for the night.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE RACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Big Brown Bear, the Yellow Dog Tramp, and
Sammy Skunk, Esq., of Sleepy Hollow, were playing
pinochle in a little log cabin.</p>

<p>Just then who should come along in the Luckymobile
but Mr. Lucky Lefthindfoot, the dear old gentleman
bunny rabbit.</p>

<p>“Honk, honk!” went his horn and “Hello, hello!”
he shouted, stopping all of a sudden, just like that, quick
as a wink, right in front of the little log hut. “Who’ll
be the next President?” and in he hopped to shake hands
with his Shady Forest friends.</p>

<p>“Hope you’ll be,” answered all three with a smile, for
everybody likes Uncle Lucky. Oh, my, yes!</p>

<p>“My, but you fellows look all mussed up,” exclaimed
the old gentleman rabbit.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t look spick and span after the fight we’ve
just had with Mr. Wicked Wolf and Danny Fox,” replied
the Yellow Dog Tramp. “Of course my clothes are not
of the latest style nor just pressed. But to wrestle with
Danny Fox would make a dress suit look like a pair of
overalls,—and maybe worse.”</p>

<p>“Come, jump into the Luckymobile,” said the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
gentleman bunny, with a kind smile. “I’ll take you all
for a ride.”</p>

<p>In climbed the Big Brown Bear and the Yellow Dog
Tramp, but Sammy Skunk suddenly remembered he had
an errand to do.</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” he apologized. “I must get a spool of
cotton for Mrs. Skunk at the Three-in-One Cent Store.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can drop you there,” suggested kind Uncle
Lucky. But Sammy Skunk wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p>“No, no! Some other time,” he shouted, as he hurried
off in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Well, where shall we go?” asked considerate Uncle
Lucky, honking the horn before he put on his goggles.
Then fastening his blue silk polkadot handkerchief over
his old wedding stovepipe hat and under his chin and
winding his gold watch and chain, he started up the
Luckymobile, his two friends on the back seat smiling
away as if they were going to the circus or a baseball game
at Carrot City.</p>

<p>After a while and a bump and a smile and maybe a
laugh or three, there came into view a big kangaroo and
a fat old bumblebee.</p>

<p>Dear, dear! Why didn’t my typewriter put this pretty
rhyme into verse. I guess it forgot I’m a poet!</p>

<p>“Stop, stop!” shouted the Kangaroo. “If you don’t
I’ll give a hop and a jump and perhaps a skip or two and
land myself right in the Luckymobile. I can jump much
farther than you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have long hind legs,” smiled Uncle Lucky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
re-flec-tive-ly, which means thinking hard while you
speak. “You’re the largest hopper I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>“You’re a pretty good jumper yourself,” answered
the Kangaroo, grinning at nice Uncle Lucky. “Let’s
have a race. I’ll give you a handicap.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need one—I’ve my dear old wedding stovepipe
hat,” answered the old gentleman rabbit, hopping out of
the Luckymobile.</p>

<p>“Who’ll be the judge?” asked the Big Brown Bear.</p>

<p>“Not me,” said the Yellow Dog Tramp, although he
should have said, “Not I.” But school is over and the
teacher is away, so we’ll let it go this once.</p>

<p>“I’ll be the judge,” said the Old Fat Bumble Bee. “I’ll
be Timekeeper, too, for I have a little gold watch.”</p>

<p>By this time the Kangaroo and dear Uncle Lucky were
all ready for the race. The old gentleman bunny was
twenty-two hops in front of the Kangaroo and the course
was over to a big rock and back to the Luckymobile.</p>

<p>“You start them off,” said the Old Fat Bumble Bee, to
the Yellow Dog Tramp.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the obliging dog, commencing
to count.</p>

<p>“One, two, three,—go!”</p>

<p>Away went dear Uncle Lucky across the meadow and
after him the great long-legged Kangaroo. Just one of
his jumps was equal to three and a half of the rabbit bunny
man.</p>

<p>“Hurry up! Uncle Lucky!” shouted the Big Brown
Bear.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<br>

<p>“Catch him!” cried the Old Bumble Bee, who was the
Kangaroo’s friend, although I forgot to mention it sooner.</p>

<p>“Go it!” shouted the Yellow Dog Tramp. “Go it,
Uncle Lucky!”</p>

<p>And then the old gentleman bunny went faster than
ever. I guess it was all the blue silk polkadot handkerchief
could do to keep his old wedding stovepipe hat from
falling off!</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” gasped Uncle Lucky, as he turned
back from the big rock on his way home to the winning
place, “that Kangaroo is gaining on me. I must hop a
little faster and then some more.”</p>

<p>“My, but that old gentleman rabbit is pretty good yet,”
thought the Kangaroo, touching the big rock and starting
back after the old gentleman bunny sprinter.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on! Uncle Lucky!” shouted the
Big Brown Bear, jumping up and down on the front seat
of the Luckymobile.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, hurry up!” barked the Yellow Dog
Tramp. “Hurry up, Uncle Lucky!”</p>

<p>“Catch him!” cried the Old Bumble Bee to the long
legged Kangaroo.</p>

<p>“Dearest me!” gasped poor Uncle Lucky, “I’m most
in!”</p>

<p>Just then, and it was mighty lucky, too, as you’ll soon
see, the blue silk polkadot handkerchief slipped off his old
wedding stovepipe, and before the old gentleman bunny
could save it that precious hat had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” shouted the Big Brown Bear. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
Uncle Lucky didn’t. Neither did the long-legged Kangaroo.
He tried hard not to step into the stovepipe hat,
but in slipped his right foot and over he went, tripperty
trip, flat on the meadow grass, and the next minute the old
gentleman bunny had touched the Luckymobile and won
the race.</p>

<p>“Hip, hurrah!” barked the Yellow Dog Tramp.</p>

<p>“Three cheers!” shouted the Big Brown Bear, but
Uncle Lucky didn’t say anything. He didn’t care nearly
so much about winning as he did to find out whether his
dear old wedding stovepipe hat were injured. Hopping
quickly back to the Kangaroo, who was just struggling to
his feet, the old gentleman rabbit exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, please be careful of my hat</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And gently pull it off.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Just hold your breath and close your eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And don’t you dare to cough.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Don’t worry,” answered the Kangaroo, hopping
about on one foot while he tugged at the old stovepipe hat.
“I’ll not cough, but I may do something else,” and he began
to look dreadfully cross. “This hat is so tight it makes
my pinky ache.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, sit down!” advised Uncle Lucky. “The
first thing you know you’ll lose your balance and that will
be the end of my dear old wedding stovepipe hat. Oh,
please sit down.”</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! The Kangaroo suddenly stubbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
his toe on a buttercup, and down he went, head over heels,
on the meadow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, dear, oh, dear, what shall I do</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If my dear old hat is broken!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Since ’63 it’s been to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A loving memory token,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">cried the old gentleman rabbit, hopping over to the sprawling
Kangaroo.</p>

<p>“There, take your old hat,” he grumbled, pulling out
his foot with a desperate tug, “I lost the race on account
of it and my temper, too. Take it away before I lose my
money.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman bunny lost no time in placing it on
his head and with a thank you and hope I meet you soon
again, he hopped into his Luckymobile and drove away
with his two good friends, the Big Brown Bear and the
Yellow Dog Tramp.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">One morning, oh, so early,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When the dew shone on the grass</div>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Little Jack Rabbit hopped up the Winding Trail in the
Shady Forest to the Forest Pool, in which Busy Beaver
had a nice bungalow.</p>

<p>Of course this little hairy swimmer was at home. Yes,
indeed. There he sat on the bank, looking here and looking
there, just as if he hadn’t a single care.</p>

<p>“Hello!” shouted the little bunny boy rabbit.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see you,” answered Busy Beaver.
“It’s a long time since you’ve made a call.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” replied the little rabbit, “but you’re not the
only busy person in the world.”</p>

<p>“I’m not busy just now. You see, I work on my new
building at night,” and Busy Beaver flapped the water
with his long flat tail.</p>

<p>“Where are the other members of the family?” asked
the polite little rabbit. You see, not having made a call
for so long a time he had forgotten all their names.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re cutting down some small trees,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Busy Beaver. “As we live on land and in the water, we
must have two houses. Then, too, as the children grow
up we need more, which keeps us busy all the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, remember me to everybody,” said the little
bunny boy rabbit, and away he hopped, lipperty lip, clipperty
clip until all of a sudden, just like that, whom should
he see but the Farmer’s Boy with a gun over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” thought the little rabbit. “Is he going
to shoot Busy Beaver, I wonder. His nice fur coat would
make a warm pair of gloves for the cold weather. I guess
I’ll warn Busy Beaver.”</p>

<p>So back hopped this kind-hearted little bunny, clipperty
clip, lipperty lip, looking over his shoulder now
and then and sometimes oftener to see if the Farmer’s
Boy was following him.</p>

<p>“What are you back for?” asked Busy Beaver, as all
out of breath Little Jack Rabbit stopped again at the
Shady Forest Pool.</p>

<p>“S-s-sh!” whispered the little bunny. “The Farmer’s
Boy is out with his gun. I just saw him up the Shady
Forest Trail. That’s why I hopped back.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you,” answered the little beaver.
“Guess I’ll take to the water. I’ve got a nice hiding place
not far from here. Good-by,” and away he swam in his
nice chestnut brown fur coat, leaving the boy bunny rabbit
all alone. Dear me! I hope the Farmer’s Boy doesn’t
shoot him before I get him safely away, too.</p>

<p>“What was that?” thought the Farmer’s Boy as Little
Jack Rabbit hopped into a hollow stump near by. “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
was that?” repeated the curious boy, tiptoeing over to the
Shady Forest Pool. I guess he had heard the slap of the
little beaver’s long flat tail as he dived down under the
water to reach his front door.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the Farmer’s Boy turned away and walked
up to the hollow stump. He was just going to thrust in
his arm when he heard a great splashing in the Shady
Forest Pool. My goodness, how Busy Beaver was flapping
the water with his big flat tail, sending the spray
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>At once the Farmer’s Boy forgot all about the hollow
stump. Lifting his gun to his shoulder, he took careful
aim, but before he could pull the trigger a big drop of
water spattered in his eye and he dropped the gun to take
out his pocket handkerchief. Wait a minute, please, I’ve
made a mistake. I meant to say he dropped his gun to
brush the water from his eye with his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance!” shouted Busy Beaver.</p>

<p>Of course the Farmer’s Boy didn’t understand this
warning, but the little rabbit did. Peeking out of the
hollow stump for just a minute, he went hipperty hop,
clipperty clip, lipperty lip down the Shady Forest Trail,
past the wooded hillside where beneath a pile of rocks
Danny Fox had his den.</p>

<p>“Now’s my chance,” thought Danny Fox, and out he
jumped from his rocky bungalow.</p>

<p>“Dear, oh, dear me! Now what shall I do? I’m a
goner, I know it!” cried the poor little bunny boy rabbit.
“Yes, I’m a goner as sure as sunshine follows rain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Stop whispering to yourself!” snarled the wicked fox.
“I’ve a good mind to eat you right now before the Policeman
Dog happens by with his big hickory stick.”</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“Now’s my chance,” thought Danny Fox.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Please do—I mean, please don’t! Oh, dear, oh, dear,
I don’t know what I mean!” cried the poor frightened
little bunny, his pink nose twinkling like a star on a frosty
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Gr-r-r!” snarled the old fox, creeping closer and
closer till his hot breath burned the shivering little rabbit’s
whiskers. “I’m going to eat you now. Make no
mistake about it. You have given me the slip once too
often.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not!” shouted a friendly voice and from
behind a clump of trees out ran the Old Brown Horse.
Turning quickly around, he let fly with his two hind feet,
sending Danny Fox through the air like a hairy four-footed
two-eared football.</p>

<p>“Never come back!” cried the Old Brown Horse, leaning
over to see if the little rabbit was all right. Of course
he was, but all a-tremble.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he cried. “Won’t you come home with
me? You can sleep in our Little Red Barn.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the Big Brown Horse, trotting
after the little bunny rabbit boy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you hop on my back you’ll be home in the
Old Bramble Patch in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” said
the Old Brown Horse, noticing how trembly the little
rabbit was.</p>

<p>So up hopped the little bunny boy and away they went,
trottery trot, bumperty, bump! By and by, after a while,
and a laugh and a smile, they came to a big wide river.</p>

<p>“I’m not a very good swimmer,” apologized the kind
four-footed animal, “but maybe I can manage to get
across.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take too many chances,” advised the little
bunny boy rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>But the Old Brown Horse kept right on wading into
the water and pretty soon it was up to his shoulder. All
of a sudden his feet couldn’t touch bottom. Only a little
bit of the top of his back was above water and Little Jack
Rabbit had to pull up his feet and hug tight to the Old
Brown Horse—hold tight to his mane, you know, so he
wouldn’t slip off.</p>

<p>They were now out in the middle of the river where
the water ran fast and furious. Dear me! It was now
hard work to swim and the Old Brown Horse began to
puff and pant as down the river they drifted with the fast
flowing current.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m all in,” panted the poor tired steed. “I
never was a fine swimmer. The race track was the place
where I could show my heels to the best of them!”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” asked the anxious little
bunny boy, as they drifted farther and farther away. The
trees on the shore nodded and seemed to beckon them to
swim to land. The white fleecy clouds up in the sky took
the shape of fingers pointing to the shore. The poor Old
Brown Horse was all tired out and his long thin legs made
poor paddle wheels. If only his feet had been flat like
Ducky Waddles it would have been an easy matter to have
made the shore and landed his little bunny rider safely on
the grass.</p>

<p>By and by Mr. Merry Sun drew close to the tip of
the Western Hills. The sky became all pinky-purple and
golden-blue. Billy Breeze began to whisper sleepy music
in the treetops and the birds to fly home to their leafy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
nests. I guess Mrs. Cow was ringing the little bell on
her leather collar to call her long-legged calf. It was past
supper time and the Twinkle Twinkle Star would be shining
from the sky.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked the little anxious bunny.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sadly replied the poor steed. “My feet
are dreadfully stiff and cold. I can hardly swish my tail
it’s so wet and heavy.”</p>

<p>Just then a voice came across the darkening waters:
“I’ll help you!”</p>

<p>“Do it quick!” gasped the Old Brown Horse, still
bravely struggling in the swift current. “I’m all in!”</p>

<p>“Oh, please come at once with a boat or a life preserver!”
shouted Little Jack Rabbit. “My dear Old
Brown Horse is nearly drowned.”</p>

<p>The next moment around a bend in the river came
the Billy Goat with his Ferryboat. You remember the
Ferryboat, don’t you? The old rowboat with a bicycle in
the middle and paddle wheels on the side to push it ahead
or backward or any way which Captain Billygoat wished
to go.</p>

<p>“Oh, hurry, hurry!” shouted the poor frightened little
bunny boy, as the Old Brown Horse floundered about in
the angry waters, his head at times almost disappearing
and his poor hind legs refusing to make another stroke.</p>

<p>“I’m coming. Keep up!” shouted back the kind Billy
Goat, making his hind legs go so fast that the spray from
the paddle wheels almost hid him from view. At last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
however, and none too soon, he came alongside the poor
tired horse.</p>

<p>“Quick! Jump in!” shouted the Billy Goat, and in
hopped the bunny rabbit boy.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Lay your head in the boat,” cried the Billy Goat to
the Old Brown Horse.</p>

<p>Dear me! The poor old fellow had scarcely enough
strength to do even that. At length, however, he began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
to breathe easier, for all he had to do was just be towed
along.</p>

<p>“You saved me from a watery grave, kind Billy Goat
Ferry Man. Some day I’ll do you a friendly deed,” said
the grateful horse when the Ferryboat reached the shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it,” replied the Billy Goat. “I’d
do anything for you and Little Jack Rabbit. Give my
regards to the folks at home!” and away paddled the good
lifesaver in his paddle-wheel rowboat to the wharf where
the little rabbit boys and girls waited for him to take them
to ice cream picnics or lollypop clambakes.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you home now that I’m nicely rested,” said
the Old Brown Horse. “I declare, I never thought this
river had so swift a current.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was so frightened,” answered the little rabbit,
climbing on his back. “I thought I’d never see the dear
Old Bramble Patch again. I want to get home to mother.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be there pretty soon,” replied the old horse,
setting off at a brisk trot.</p>

<p>As they neared the Old Bramble Patch they saw Lady
Love standing at the gate, shading her eyes with her front
paw.</p>

<p>You see, we often grow tired of the same old thing.
Our roller skates are put aside, our bat and ball don’t
interest us; we don’t wish to even run about and look for
a good time. And that’s just the way Little Jack Rabbit
felt. So, what did he do? Well, he didn’t do anything
till Lady Love, his patient bunny rabbit mother, suggested
that he read a book.</p>

<p>“What shall I read?” he asked, wiggling his little pink
nose as much as to say, “I’d rather eat a lollypop.” But
his mother didn’t notice his twinkling nose,—or, if she
did, she merely overlooked it.</p>

<p>“Yes, why don’t you read a book,” she repeated.
“Books are like friends, sometimes they teach us things,
sometimes they amuse us, and sometimes——”</p>

<p>She had no need to finish her sentence, for the little
rabbit boy had hopped over to the bookshelf.</p>

<p>After looking over the row of pretty books he picked
out one that was called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Bunny Boy’s Cracker Animals.</span>”</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting,” said the little rabbit boy to
himself, and, hopping into a chair, he began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once upon a time there lived a Bunny Boy Rabbit
who had a little knapsack in which he kept animal crackers.
Now this little bunny boy was so fond of his cracker
animals that he never could bear to bite off a head or an
ear, or a trunk or a tail. By and by his knapsack became
so full that it could hold no more. And then something
happened. As he hopped along one day he thought to
himself, ‘What a racket those Animal Crackers are making
in my knapsack. Maybe they are trying to get out.’</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just what they were doing. And all of a
sudden, quicker than a wink, the knapsack burst open and</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">And the Buffalo Bull with his shaggy hair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“‘Come back, come back!’ shouted the bunny boy rabbit.</p>

<p>“‘No, siree!’ answered the Animal Crackers, ‘we’re going
back to our little Cracker Boxes!’ and away they
went, leaving the Bunny Boy Rabbit to fill his knapsack
with clover tops or lettuce leaves.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Now what shall I do?” cried Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“Why not visit Uncle John Hare? I’ll pack your
clothes in a jiffy,” suggested the little bunny’s mother,
looking up from her ironing.</p>

<p>Pretty soon along came the Old Dog Driver with his
billy goat team.</p>

<p>“I shall miss you,” said Lady Love, kissing her bunny
boy, as he hopped into the carriage.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus, if that isn’t my little
bunny nephew!” shouted dear Uncle Lucky, as the carriage
stopped by Lily Pond Lake.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I’m on my way to Uncle John Hare,” answered Little
Jack Rabbit. “I’ve a package for him and my knapsack
is packed full of clothes. Mother bought me a new tie.”</p>

<p>“What, are you going to make a visit?” asked dear
Uncle Lucky, anxiously. He never could keep away very
long from his little rabbit nephew. Dear me, no! Uncle
Lucky was so fond of Little Jack Rabbit that he wanted
to be with him all the time, and even oftener.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” went on poor Uncle Lucky, a lonely feeling
spreading all over him from his toes to his head, “I’ll
miss you dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“That’s what mother said this morning when she kissed
me good-by,” answered Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame her,” said the old gentleman bunny.</p>

<p>“She said something else, too,” added his little rabbit
nephew.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked dear Uncle Lucky.</p>

<p>“She told me to say every morning when I hopped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
of bed, ‘Every day and in every way, I grow better and
better.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to do what mother says,” advised Uncle
Lucky. “Do what mother says and you’ll never be sorry.”</p>

<p>“What did you say, little bunny?” asked a motherly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>looking lady goose, one of the passengers on her way to
Goose Creek, Meadowland.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just thinking aloud,” answered the little
bunny boy rabbit. “But what’s the use of wishing?
Wishes don’t come true.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes they do,” laughed the nice, kind lady
goose, placing her soft feathered wing around him. “I
once had an old grandmother goose who told me stories.
I haven’t forgotten them. Oh, my, no! I told them to a
man and he put them all in a book called “Grandmother
Goosey’s Bedtime Rimes”!</p>

<p>“Tell me one,” said Little Jack Rabbit, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” began the kind lady goose, but
before she could say another word the bunny boy was
sound asleep.</p>

<p>By and by the Old Dog Driver shouted, “Turnip
City! All out!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, it was Turnip City! Just across Lettuce
Square on the front porch of his pretty white house stood
Uncle John Hare and behind him in the doorway, Mrs.
Daisy Duck, his nice old housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” cried Little Jack Rabbit, taking off his
cap to the Old Lady Goose. Then away he hopped across
the square and up the walk that led from the little white
gate to the front piazza of Uncle John’s neat little bungalow.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see you,” cried the nice old gentleman
bunny, patting his small nephew on the head.</p>

<p>“And so am I,” quacked Mrs. Daisy Duck. “Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
there’ll be somebody young and frisky in the house.”</p>

<p>“What, am I growing so old?” asked Uncle John
Hare, hopping about on the piazza with Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

John Hare. “Mrs. Daisy Duck thinks I don’t know, but
one day I hop-tiptoed after her. Don’t tell her, I think
she has a nest in her little shack. Maybe someday there’ll
be a brood of ducklings.”</p>

<p>“What are you whispering about?” asked the old lady
duck, with a quack and a flap of her wings. “Secrets?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered the old gentleman bunny. “Or,
perhaps, advice. Give you three guesses.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t time,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck, bustling
out to the kitchen to look at the lollypop stew and carrot
cake. “I must think about supper.”</p>

<p>“Come to your own little room,” said Uncle John
Hare, leading the way up the winding stair. His little
rabbit nephew followed, his knapsack swinging over his
shoulder and his striped candy cane dangling from his
elbow.</p>

<p>“There,” exclaimed the dear old gentleman hare,
throwing open the door, “nothing has been changed except
the calendar. Every day I tore off the date, saying
to myself, ‘Perhaps to-morrow he’ll come again to visit
his old uncle.’ It came true this morning, so it did,” and
with a happy sigh the loving old bunny hare sat down in
the rocking chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, your little room has been kept just the same for
you,” he went on, “and you must make a long, long visit
this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will,” answered Little Jack Rabbit, with a
laugh. “Mother said I might stay as long as you wanted
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, that won’t be long enough,” answered Uncle
John Hare. “Come, part your hair down the middle of
your back and wash your paws for supper. I smell the
lollypop stew.”</p>

<p>It took little Jack Rabbit less than two and a half minutes
to make himself spick and span. Then with a hop,
skip and a jump he followed his nice old Uncle to the dining
room where Mrs. Daisy Duck had a lovely supper
waiting for them.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’d like to hear what was on the table. Lots
of little boys and girls don’t know what rabbits eat, I imagine.
Well, there was carrot cake and lettuce marmalade,
carrot jelly and turnip tea, lollypop stew and cabbage
custard. A mighty nice sort of a supper for anybody,
seems to me.</p>

<p>Just as they were finishing the cabbage custard there
came a loud knocking at the front door.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?” asked Uncle John Hare.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon find out,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck, waddling
out of the room with her napkin under her left wing.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. John Hare at home?” inquired a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here,” answered the old gentleman bunny,
hopping out into the hall. But when he saw who was calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
he wished he had hidden in the cellar. There stood
the Ragged Rabbit Giant. You could see only the tops
of his boots, for they were as high as the front door. Why,
his waistcoat was even with the roof of the little white
house and his gold chain tinkled against the red brick
chimney every time he leaned down to speak to Mrs. Daisy
Duck.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” asked Uncle John Hare, as
soon as he had caught his breath. “I’d invite you into supper,
only you couldn’t accept. Maybe you’d like me to
hand you out a cabbage cup custard. Mrs. Daisy Duck
is quite famous for her cabbage cup custards.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want any custard,” answered the Ragged
Rabbit Giant. “I don’t like sweet things. Have you a
cabbage leaf cigar?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I think I have,” answered the old
gentleman hare in a trembly voice, hopping back into the
sitting room.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the giant grew restless. He shuffled his
big feet, looked at his watch and then all of a sudden
shouted, “Hurry up with that cabbage leaf cigar. I could
have walked to Cuba in my seven league boots by this time
for a good Smokerino.”</p>

<p>Dear, dear me! I’ve been dreadfully worried while
dear Uncle John Hare has been hunting for a cabbage
leaf cigar for fear he wouldn’t be able to find it. I don’t
know what I’d do if a Ragged Rabbit Giant was waiting
outside my little white house on the corner of Lettuce
Square and Turnip Street, Turnip City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve found it,” answered poor Uncle John Hare, hopping
out with Little Jack Rabbit to the front porch.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” exclaimed the giant, looking at the
little bunny boy as he lighted the cigar, “if this isn’t Lady
Love’s little rabbit. Howdy, young bunny. I must be
going home. Good-by. Come to see me soon,” and away
stalked the big rabbitman in his seven league boots to
his castle on Tip Top, Sky-high Mountain, under the stars,
for it would be night-time when he arrived home, although
he could cover almost a mile every time he took a stride,
and when he jumped,—dear me, I can’t figure how much
space he covered,—maybe three times a mile.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he’s gone,” said Mrs. Daisy Duck
from her hiding place. “I declare, my heart beat so loudly
I mistook it for the Old Grandfather Clock. Dear, dearie
me! I don’t like such great big bunny men. Little ones
are nicer,” and hugging Little Jack Rabbit, she gave him
a cough drop from a little box she carried in her calico
apron pocket.</p>

<p>By and by, after Uncle John Hare had finished smoking
his cabbage leaf cigar, he said to his small nephew:</p>

<p>“Let’s have a game of pinochle.”</p>

<p>But, goodness me! The little rabbit was so drowsy
that he could hardly keep his eyes open and pretty soon
he let all the cards drop to the floor.</p>

<p>“Hoity toity!” exclaimed Uncle John Hare, looking
up. But when he saw that the Sand Man had filled his
nephew’s eyes with Dream Dust he covered up the little
bunny boy and let him sleep where he was until morning.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wake up, wake up! It’s morning now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Farmer is milking the little black cow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Rooster is blowing his shiny tin horn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Billy Breeze’s whistling a tune in the corn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Goodness me! Up jumped Little Jack Rabbit. You
remember that the tired little bunny boy had been too
sleepy to hop upstairs after playing a game of pinochle
with Uncle John Hare, and had fallen asleep in a big
arm chair for the night. That’s where we left him, and
now we find him wide awake.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurry up, the buckwheat cake</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Is sizzling hot upon your plate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you don’t hurry Mrs. Mouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">May take it to her tiny house,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">quacked Mrs. Daisy Duck, the old gentleman hare’s
housekeeper.</p>

<p>“I’ll hurry,” answered the little rabbit boy, and in less
than a jiffy he had combed his hair down the middle of his
back, washed his paws and repeated the little verse that
Lady Love, his pretty bunny mother, had taught him:</p>

<p>“Every day in every way, I grow better and better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>After that he and his big appetite hopped into the dining
room. There stood dear Uncle John Hare, looking
over the <em>Turnip City News</em>.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you sleep?” he asked, gazing up over
his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Tip top,” replied his small bunny nephew. “I never
heard a thing until the Big Red Rooster went ‘cock-a-doodle-do’
on his little tin horn. I guess he woke me up.”</p>

<p>“I imagine so,” replied the old gentleman bunny, with
a twinkle in his eye. “My, but you were tired last night
after your long ride. Let’s see what Mrs. Daisy Duck
has for us.”</p>

<p>Then down sat the two little rabbits as the nice old
lady duck waddled in with carrot coffee, clover cereal and
buckwheat cakes covered with pink lollypop syrup. Oh,
me, oh, my! wasn’t the breakfast good! Well I guess yes
three times and maybe four.</p>

<p>Just then somebody knocked on the door, one, two,
three, bingo!</p>

<p>“Who’s that, I wonder?” exclaimed Uncle John Hare.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck. “You go on
with your breakfast. Most likely it’s the gas man with
a bill.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t. No, it was somebody else, only worse.
I guess sometimes we ought to be thankful it’s only the
gas man!</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked the old gentleman bunny, as Mrs.
Daisy Duck returned with a worried expression on her
face and a piece of paper in her bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, dear, oh, dear! It seems to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That Mr. Trouble Man</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Is always knocking on the door</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As loudly as he can,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">answered Mrs. Daisy Duck.</p>

<p>“Who is it and what does he want and what’s his
name?” asked the old gentleman hare, pulling the napkin
from under his chin to wipe his gold-rimmed spectacles
instead of his whiskers. Wasn’t that careless of
him? Well I should say so, especially as there wasn’t a
drop of syrup on them,—I mean his spectacles of course,
not his whiskers.</p>

<p>“Read this note,” whispered Mrs. Daisy Duck, looking
anxiously over her shoulder as if fearing somebody or
something might suddenly come in through the half open
door.</p>

<p>Uncle John Hare quickly opened the envelope and
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I want a million carrot cents</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And I want them mighty quick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Just hand them to my messenger</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or he’ll hit you with my stick!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Dear, oh, dear!” exclaimed the poor old gentleman
bunny, dropping this dreadful note on the carpet, “what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Do something quick,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
glancing timidly over her shoulder. Indeed she had already
almost twisted her long neck into a bowknot.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image272" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image272.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“Twice to the left, three to the right!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“All right,” answered the old gentleman hare with a
sigh, hopping over to a big iron safe in the corner and
squatting down to turn back and forth the little silver knob.
Over the door was printed in big gold letters:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“John Hare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Turnip City.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, dear me! He was so nervous that the door
wouldn’t obey his trembling paw. Over and over, around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
and around, he turned the little knob, repeating the combination
half aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Twice to the left, three to the right!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then stop at the spot where it says ‘Good night!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then a loud knocking came at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Please hurry,” cried the frightened lady duck housekeeper,
looking anxiously into the kitchen. “The messenger
is at the back door.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! I’m all muddled up!” cried the old gentleman
hare.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bing, bang, bung!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Your doorbell I have rung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Now if my knocking you don’t hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll rattle every chandelier!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">shouted a voice.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait a minute,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck
through the keyhole. “Mr. John Hare is trying to open
his safe. You make so much noise he can’t find the combination.”</p>

<p>For a little while the knocking ceased. But, dear me!
Uncle John Hare couldn’t remember the combination.
Scratching his long left ear with his right hind foot, he
turned to Little Jack Rabbit with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can unlock it.”</p>

<p>But the little rabbit boy was no more successful. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
indeed, although he turned the knob around and started
all over again. I guess he never would have found the
combination if Bobbie Redvest, the dear little friendly
robin, hadn’t hopped to the open window.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pull the little knob out just one inch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then say to yourself, ‘Why, it’s a cinch!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Next, turn the knob to figure four</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And you’ll have no trouble with the iron door,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">he whispered.</p>

<p>At once the little rabbit followed the pretty robin’s
directions and in less time than I can take to tell it, the
safe door flew open and out rolled a million carrot cents,
each one counting out loud as it touched the floor! “One,
Two, Three,” and so on, right up to a million! Wasn’t
that wonderful? Well, I just guess it was. I never had
a Flying Eagle Cent that could count more than one!</p>

<p>“Get a bag,” whispered Uncle John Hare, and filling
it with carrot cents that good lady duck housekeeper
opened the kitchen door, and handed it to an ugly little
dwarf.</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am,” he said, touching his red peaked
hat with a crooked forefinger. Then slinging the bag over
his shoulder, he trudged around the house and through
the little gateway in the white picket fence to the Fairy
Forest that lay some two thousand hops to the North of
Turnip City.</p>

<p>“Has he gone?” asked Uncle John Hare, dusting off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
his knees and pulling down his pink waistcoat. “Are you
sure he’s gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answered Mrs. Daisy Duck, with a happy
quack. “He’s gone, thank goodness! I hope he’ll not
come back for many a year.”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image275" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image275.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“Thank you, ma’am,” he said.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Never can tell,” mused the old gentleman rabbit.
“The Ragged Rabbit Giant will return more than a million
carrot cents in less time than that.”</p>

<p>“Trust the fairies,” cautioned Bobbie Redvest. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
have asked the giant to lend them money,” and away fluttered
the little bird to the old apple tree.</p>

<p>But even after Bobbie Redvest had cautioned Little
Jack Rabbit that curious little bunny boy wanted to hop
over to the Fairy Forest.</p>

<p>“No, sireebus!” cried Uncle John Hare. “You do
what that little robin says and you’ll not go far wrong.”</p>

<p>“All right, Uncle John,” answered the little bunny boy
cheerfully, for he was a good little rabbit and had learned
to obey his elders without sulking, which is the better
way, after all. For when we do a thing with a smile it’s
so much easier. I wonder why, but maybe you know, little
reader. If not, Mother will tell you, as sure as lollypops
come on sticks and ice cream in cones.</p>

<p>Well, the little bunny boy rabbit had a lovely visit and
when it came time for him to take the Stagecoach home
he kissed Uncle John Hare good-by, nor did he forget
Mrs. Daisy Duck. “Good-by, good-by!” he shouted from
his seat beside the Old Dog Driver.</p>

<p>“Come again soon,” cried the old gentleman hare,
waving his stovepipe hat. “Give my love to Mother.”</p>

<p>Away rattled the Billy Goat Stage Coach across Lettuce
Square, down Potato Street and out on Radish Road that
led to Rabbitville, fifteen thousand five hundred hops to
the south.</p>

<p>By and by the Old Dog Driver took his pipe out of his
mouth and shouted, “Carrot City!” Then pulling in his
team of billy goats, waited for an old gander to alight.
It took the old feathered gentleman quite a while to flop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
down the two little steps at the back of the stage, but at last
he was safely on the ground. Then as soon as a fat lady
pig, wearing a purple sunbonnet and black mitts, had
seated herself, the Old Dog Driver clicked his teeth with
his tongue and said “Gid-ap!”</p>

<p>Away bounded the billy goat team, shaking their
horns, which were tipped with little gold thimbles, and
throwing out their hoofs, shod with bright steel shoes. By
and by they came to Lettucemere, a pretty village by the
Bubbling Brook. Here the Lady Pig got out and in
jumped a big mooly cow. Mrs. O’Mooly was her name.
She wore a big yellow hat and a pink shirt waist and on her
two hind feet a pair of white kid boots. My, but she was
a stylish looking lady cow.</p>

<p>“Gid-ap!” clicked the Old Dog Driver, and away went
the nimble little billy goats until by and by, after a while,
and a bump and a smile, they came to the Old Bramble
Patch. There at the gate stood Lady Love, the little rabbit’s
pretty mother. Her simple gingham dress with white
lace collar seemed a beautiful gown to the little rabbit,
and her eyes two stars as she folded him to her breast and
whispered, “Home again to Mother.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
